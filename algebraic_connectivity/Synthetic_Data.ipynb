        "\n",
        "    Follow all guidelines below:\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. Clinical Narrative Constraints\n",
        "    - The narrative must sound clinically realistic, detailed, and internally coherent, but fully fictional.\n",
        "    - Focus on 1–2 dominant organ systems.\n",
        "    - You may include minor details from 1 additional system, but keep the story centered.\n",
        "\n",
        "    2. Entity Density\n",
        "    - Include 6–10 clinically meaningful conditions, symptoms, or findings.\n",
        "    - Most notes should contain 5–9 entities.\n",
        "    - A minority may contain 12–20, but never exceed 24.\n",
        "    - Avoid enumerating many unrelated comorbidities.\n",
        "    - Use combinations only when clinically plausible (e.g., “dyspnea with pleuritic chest pain,” not random clusters).\n",
        "\n",
        "    3. Epidemiologic & Diversity Controls\n",
        "    - Sample diseases from across the entire prevalence spectrum:\n",
        "        * ~20% of patients: very common conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes)\n",
        "        * ~40% of patients: moderately common conditions,\n",
        "        * ~30% of patients: uncommon but not rare conditions,\n",
        "        * ~10% of patients: rare or highly specific conditions,\n",
        "    - Within each patient, mix prevalence levels when clinically appropriate.\n",
        "    - Actively avoid \"default\" diagnoses—challenge yourself to pick less obvious conditions.\n",
        "    - If you've mentally used a condition recently, deliberately choose a different one.\n",
        "\n",
        "    4. Coherence & Causality\n",
        "    - Anchor the narrative in a clear primary complaint.\n",
        "    - Build outward with causal or temporal links (e.g., “three-day worsening,” “after a recent infection,” “following exertion”).\n",
        "    - Symptoms and findings should cluster naturally into coherent modules.\n",
        "\n",
        "    5. System Diversity Instructions\n",
        "    - Randomly select the primary organ system for each case from: cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, neurological, musculoskeletal,\n",
        "    endocrine, renal, hematologic, dermatologic, psychiatric, immunologic, ENT, ophthalmologic.\n",
        "    - Weight rare systems (ophthalmologic, hematologic) equally with common ones (cardiovascular).\n",
        "\n",
        "    6. Explicit Anti-Repetition Language\n",
        "    - CRITICAL: Do not fall into repetitive patterns. Each patient should feel genuinely unique.\n",
        "    - Before selecting conditions, mentally \"reset\" and avoid recent choices.\n",
        "    - Favor specificity over generality (e.g., \"polymyalgia rheumatica\" over \"joint pain\").\n",
        "\n",
        "    7. Safe Content Restrictions\n",
        "    - No real names, hospitals, dates, or identifiers.\n",
        "    - No explicit medications unless clearly tied to the condition.\n",
        "    - Avoid long lists of labs, imaging results, or repeated values.\n",
        "\n",
        "    8. Output Format\n",
        "    Return only the paragraph text, with no labels or bullet points.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example style:\n",
        "    A 29-year-old female graduate student reports daily headaches, blurred vision, and poor concentration for three weeks.\n",
        "    Pain is throbbing, worsens with light, and improves in dark rooms. She denies nausea but notes mild neck stiffness\n",
        "    and jaw tension. She sleeps only five hours per night. Past history includes mild asthma. No caffeine or drug use.\n",
