P0002,"A 58-year-old man presents with two weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a productive cough that began after a presumed upper respiratory infection; sputum is yellow-green and he reports intermittent low-grade fevers. Over the past 48 hours he developed pleuritic right-sided chest pain and a small amount of hemoptysis, with wakening by orthopnea at night. He has a 30-pack-year smoking history and a remote provoked deep venous thrombosis. Known COPD and chronic hypertension are in his history. He notes new audible wheeze and decreased exercise tolerance compared with baseline COPD symptoms. Given acute worsening with pleuritic pain and prior DVT, he is concerned about superimposed pneumonia versus pulmonary embolism; he denies calf swelling or recent travel."
P0003,A 35-year-old male reports 10 days of progressive exertional dyspnea and sharp left-sided pleuritic chest pain. Symptoms began several days after a prolonged 10-hour flight and were preceded by a mild upper respiratory prodrome; he developed a persistent nonproductive cough and low-grade fevers. Over the past 48 hours he noted scant hemoptysis and new right calf swelling with intermittent cramping. He describes exertional lightheadedness and palpitations. He is a current smoker (≈10 pack-years) with no prior thrombotic history. At home he measured oxygen saturation in the low 90s and had tachycardia at rest. He denies recent surgery or active malignancy. He is concerned about possible pulmonary embolism versus atypical pneumonia.
P0004,"A 45-year-old woman presents with six weeks of progressive, intense generalized pruritus, worst at night, causing excoriations and sleep disturbance. She also describes increasing fatigue and a dull right upper quadrant discomfort that follows fatty meals. Over the past week she noticed pale, clay-colored stools and subtle yellowing of the sclera. On exam she reports small yellow eyelid plaques previously noted by her cosmetician. She has a remote history of hypercholesterolemia diagnosed two years ago and intermittent dry eyes and dry mouth for several months. She drinks minimally and has no recent travel. The constellation of cholestatic symptoms, sicca complaints, and xanthelasma raises concern for an autoimmune cholangiopathy such as primary biliary cholangitis."

P0007,"A 50-year-old man presents with six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent nonproductive cough that began after a self-limited ""bronchitis."" He now notes intermittent pleuritic left-sided chest discomfort and mild blood-tinged sputum on two occasions. Over the past week he developed unilateral left calf swelling and tenderness after a prolonged airplane trip. He reports daytime fatigue and loud snoring with witnessed pauses consistent with obstructive sleep apnea; he has well-controlled hypertension and a 25 pack-year smoking history but quit five years ago. He denies fever or orthopnea. The constellation—post-travel calf swelling, pleuritic pain, worsening exertional breathlessness—raises concern for deep venous thrombosis with possible pulmonary embolism."
P0008,"A 94-year-old male reports two months of progressive postprandial crampy epigastric pain, with a clear worsening over the past three weeks. He describes early satiety and a ten-pound unintentional weight loss as he has begun to avoid meals for fear of pain. He has noted intermittent dark stools and progressive fatigue but denies vomiting or fevers. He has a history of atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease stage 3, and he recalls a brief episode of lightheadedness several days ago. Bowel habits are otherwise unchanged. Family reports subtle decline in baseline mobility and appetite. He is concerned about ongoing weakness and loss of weight and seeks evaluation for possible bowel ischemia or obstructive process contributing to his anorexia and bleeding."
P0009,"An 80-year-old man reports four weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough that began after a brief upper respiratory illness. He notes decreased exercise tolerance—now unable to climb a flight of stairs without stopping—and intermittent low-grade fevers with a three-kilogram weight loss. On review he denies purulent sputum or chest pain but describes worsening breathlessness with minimal exertion and occasional lightheadedness. Past pulmonary history is notable for known interstitial lung disease consistent with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; he has baseline hypertension and a remote smoking history. Home caregiver observed increased work of breathing and falling oxygen saturations with activity. On exam he has bibasilar inspiratory crackles and early digital clubbing, suggesting a subacute exacerbation of his chronic pulmonary fibrosis."
P0010,"A 53-year-old male presents with six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent productive cough following a community-acquired pneumonia treated outpatient. Sputum is thick and green-tinged with intermittent streaks of blood; coughing provokes sharp pleuritic right-sided chest pain. He reports low-grade fevers, drenching night sweats, and unintentional 8-lb weight loss over two months. Past history notable for COPD and well-controlled hypertension; 30 pack-year former smoker. He notes increased baseline sputum volume and recurrent bronchitic exacerbations compared with his prior course, raising concern for postinfectious bronchiectasis or secondary infection, and he is also worried about possible pulmonary embolism after a recent long car trip. Activity tolerance is markedly reduced."
P0011,"A 50-year-old female reports progressive shortness of breath and pleuritic right-sided chest pain for five days, acutely worse with minimal exertion. Symptoms began after a ten-hour flight and were accompanied by scant hemoptysis and intermittent palpitations; she describes resting tachycardia at home. She also noticed right calf swelling and tenderness over the past week. Cough is minimal and unlike previous asthma flares; she has a remote history of asthma and a 20 pack-year smoking history. She denies fever, recent upper respiratory infection, or leg trauma. No prior thrombotic events. Activities are limited by dyspnea, and she is concerned about a blood clot or pulmonary embolus."
P0012,"A 20-year-old female college student presents with sudden-onset pleuritic left-sided chest pain and progressive shortness of breath for 36 hours. Pain is sharp, worse with deep inspiration and cough; she reports scant hemoptysis and lightheadedness when ambulating. She noted increasing right calf swelling and tenderness over the prior three days after a 10-hour bus trip, and she takes combined oral contraceptives. At home she felt tachycardic and more breathless with minimal exertion. She denies fever, recent surgery, or illicit drug use and has no prior clotting history. Symptoms are most concerning for pulmonary embolism from an ipsilateral deep venous thrombosis; she seeks evaluation given worsening hypoxia and persistent pleuritic pain."
P0013,"A 62-year-old male reports two months of progressive exertional dyspnea, initially only with stairs and now limiting his walking to a few blocks. He describes intermittent exertional chest tightness and two brief near-syncope episodes while climbing, associated with new palpitations. Over the last three weeks he has developed worsening bilateral ankle swelling and persistent dry cough with rare streaks of blood. He had an unprovoked deep vein thrombosis about nine months ago that was treated briefly, and he carries a remote diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a 30-pack-year smoking history. No fevers or orthopnea. Symptoms suggest possible chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension with right‑sided congestion; he seeks evaluation for progressive exertional limitation and intermittent hemoptysis."

P0016,
P0017,"A 7-year-old female presents with five days of persistent cough and progressive noisy breathing that acutely worsened over the past 48 hours. Symptoms began after a runny nose and low-grade fever following exposure at daycare; parents report intermittent wheeze and increased work of breathing with activity. Three days ago she had a brief choking episode while eating, after which she developed frequent coughing and a new inspiratory stridor. At-home use of a quick-acting bronchodilator produced only minimal relief. She has mild decreased oral intake and sleep disruption from coughing. Past medical history notable for atopic dermatitis and a single reactive-airways episode last winter. Examination at home was perceived as pallid with faster breathing, prompting evaluation for possible foreign body aspiration versus asthma exacerbation."
P0018,
P0019,"A 6-year-old male presents with a 48-hour history of progressively worsening right-sided throat pain and fever. Symptoms began after a brief nasal congestion and sore throat; he developed severe odynophagia and now refuses solids, with poor oral intake. Parents note drooling and difficulty opening his mouth consistent with trismus. On exam he is febrile with tender ipsilateral cervical lymphadenitis and marked swelling of the right tonsillar pillar with muffled voice. Concern is for a peritonsillar abscess complicating streptococcal pharyngitis; retropharyngeal extension is in the differential. Decreased urine output and dry mucous membranes suggest early dehydration. No known immunodeficiency and no prior airway surgery. Caregiver requests urgent evaluation for potential drainage."
P0020,"A 34-year-old male reports six weeks of progressive postprandial epigastric pain, early satiety, and persistent bloating that began after a self-limited viral gastroenteritis. He describes frequent nausea with intermittent nonbilious vomiting of undigested food several hours after eating, worsening with solids and fatty meals, and occasional regurgitation. He has unintentionally lost about 12 pounds and notes decreased appetite. Bowel movements are intact but occasionally greasy. He denies fevers or overt jaundice but endorses episodic lightheadedness and palpitations when standing, especially after emesis. No prior abdominal surgery. He tried antacids with minimal relief. Symptoms are most consistent with postinfectious gastroparesis with functional dyspepsia and possible dehydration-related orthostatic symptoms; he seeks evaluation for gastric emptying assessment and nutritional support."
P0021,"A 28-year-old man presents with three days of progressive blurred vision in his right eye, described as a central gray patch with reduced acuity and color desaturation. He notes sharp periorbital pain that worsens with eye movement and intermittent photophobia; symptoms began after a week of nasal congestion and sore throat. He also reports new, brief numb tingling episodes in his feet and a persistent fatigue that is limiting exercise tolerance. He denies trauma, diplopia, or significant headache but acknowledges a prior remote episode of transient visual blurring last year that resolved. On exam he notes difficulty distinguishing red from green and perceives the central area as darker. He is concerned about inflammatory or demyelinating causes and seeks urgent neuro-ophthalmology evaluation."
P0022,"A 22-year-old male presents with five days of progressive blurred vision in the left eye, described as a central gray spot that worsened over 48 hours. He notes sharp pain with eye movement and increased photophobia but denies trauma or discharge. Color perception is dulled when compared to the right eye, and he reports a new left-sided relative afferent pupillary defect on home flashlight testing. Two weeks prior he had a brief viral upper respiratory illness with sore throat and low-grade fever. Concurrently he has experienced intermittent paresthesias in the right hand and mild occipital headache without neck stiffness. No prior ophthalmic disease or recent travel; he denies nausea, syncope, or skin rash. He is concerned about sudden vision loss."
P0023,"A 38-year-old woman presents with ten days of subacute blurring of the left eye, describing central scotoma and colors appearing faded compared with the right eye. Symptoms began after a brief upper respiratory illness and have progressed; she now has aching periocular pain that worsens with eye movement and intermittent photophobia. She reports new fatigue and two episodes of transient numbness and tingling in the right hand over the past month. No eye discharge or trauma. She has a history of autoimmune thyroid disease and episodic migraine without aura. Vision changes are interfering with driving and reading. She denies systemic rash, joint swelling, or fevers. Concern is raised for optic neuritis versus inflammatory optic neuropathy, prompting urgent ophthalmology and neurology evaluation."
P0024,
P0025,"An 84-year-old man presents with two weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and increasing lower extremity swelling. He now wakes at night gasping for air twice weekly and has mild orthopnea; family notes new-onset palpitations and fatigue for four days. He has a history of hypertension and a bioprosthetic aortic valve; he also carries a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Onset followed a brief viral cough that did not fully resolve. He describes decreased exercise tolerance from walking one block to remaining seated most of the day. No chest pain but reports lightheadedness with standing. Recent home pulse checks were irregularly irregular. He denies hemoptysis, focal neurologic symptoms, or recent invasive procedures."
P0026,"A 19-year-old female presents with four days of acute rotational vertigo occurring in spells of 30–60 minutes, classically provoked by head turns. The episodes began after a recent upper respiratory infection with nasal congestion and sore throat; she subsequently developed right‑ear fullness, intermittent high‑pitched tinnitus, and subjective decreased hearing on the right. Associated symptoms include persistent nausea and two episodes of non‑bilious emesis, plus marked imbalance with veering to the right when walking. She denies headache, focal weakness, or visual loss. Symptoms are partially relieved by staying still and worsen on rising from bed. She has noticed brief horizontal eye jerks during attacks and reports no recent head trauma or new medications."
P0027,"A 62-year-old woman reports three months of progressive exertional dyspnea that now limits climbing a single flight of stairs. She describes intermittent presyncope with minimal exertion and a chronic productive cough with two recent episodes of streaky hemoptysis. Pleuritic right-sided chest discomfort accompanies deep breaths. Over the past month she has developed new bilateral ankle swelling and recalls unilateral right calf pain after a prolonged car trip several months earlier; she was told she previously had a ""blood clot."" Past medical history is notable for well-controlled hypertension. She denies fevers but reports a 6 kg unintentional weight loss. These symptoms raise concern for a pulmonary vascular process superimposed on chronic airways disease."
P0028,"A 95-year-old female reports acute, painless loss of vision in her left eye over the past 48 hours, preceded by two weeks of intermittent temporal headache and scalp tenderness. She also describes jaw claudication when chewing and new prominent central blurring with metamorphopsia in the right eye, where she has known age-related macular degeneration. On review she notes morning shoulder stiffness and difficulty combing hair suggestive of polymyalgia rheumatica; she has longstanding hypertension. Family members report the left eye is now essentially nonfunctional. No trauma or flashes of light. Symptoms cluster temporally, raising concern for arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy secondary to giant cell arteritis threatening the remaining vision."
P0029,"A 45-year-old male construction worker reports six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent productive cough that began after a presumed upper respiratory infection. Sputum is purulent with intermittent scant hemoptysis and he describes focal pleuritic right-sided chest discomfort. He also notes low-grade fevers, drenching night sweats and an unintentional 12-pound weight loss over the past month. He is a former 20-pack-year smoker and reports regular silica dust exposure on job sites. On exam he has coarse bibasilar crackles and mild digital clubbing; there is no peripheral edema or known immunosuppression. Symptoms have limited his activity and prompted referral for chest imaging and sputum studies."
P0030,"A 95-year-old female presents with abrupt, painless loss of vision in the right eye over the past 48 hours, preceded by three weeks of progressive central distortion and intermittent scotoma. She describes a new right temporal headache with scalp tenderness when combing her hair and intermittent jaw ache when chewing; she denies eye discharge or fever. Past history includes long-standing hypertension and age-related macular degeneration in the left eye. On brief ophthalmic assessment there is markedly reduced right visual acuity with a relative afferent pupillary defect. These features are concerning for giant cell arteritis with impending ischemic optic involvement; urgent temporal artery evaluation and inflammatory markers have been arranged for expedited assessment."
P0031,"A 56-year-old man presents with four weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea that began after a prolonged transcontinental flight. Initially attributed to deconditioning, shortness of breath has escalated over the past week with new right-sided pleuritic chest pain and intermittent blood-tinged sputum. He also notes a swollen, tender right calf and increased night-time snoring with daytime fatigue. Past medical history includes well-controlled hypertension and a remote diagnosis of mild COPD; he is a former 30 pack-year smoker. He denies fever or recent upper respiratory infection. The constellation of acute dyspnea, pleuritic pain, hemoptysis, and unilateral leg swelling raises concern for pulmonary embolism complicating deep venous thrombosis, with underlying cardiopulmonary risk exacerbated by sleep-disordered breathing."
P0032,"A 21-year-old woman presents with six weeks of daily, throbbing bifrontal headaches and intermittent visual obscurations. Headaches are worse on lying down and with Valsalva, often accompanied by transient binocular diplopia and brief episodes of blurred vision lasting seconds. She describes new right-sided pulsatile tinnitus and morning nausea but denies fever. She has noted a 20-pound weight gain over six months and a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome with oligomenorrhea. Primary care ophthalmoscopy reportedly demonstrated optic disc edema. No prior head trauma or migraine history; headaches started after a period of increased screen time and irregular sleep. Symptoms have gradually worsened, interfering with classes and driving, prompting evaluation for increased intracranial pressure."
P0033,"A 40-year-old man presents with progressive shortness of breath that began two days ago and acutely worsened overnight. He describes sharp, pleuritic right-sided chest pain with a dry cough and a single episode of scant hemoptysis. Symptoms began after a long transcontinental flight and are accompanied by palpitations, lightheadedness, and low-grade fever. He notes new left calf swelling and tenderness and feels more fatigued with minimal exertion. At baseline he is ambulatory and worked full time until symptoms started; past medical history is notable only for well-controlled hypertension. He is a current smoker, denies recent upper respiratory infection, and has no known cardiac disease or prior thromboembolism."
P0034,"A 40-year-old woman presents with four days of an acute paracentral scotoma and metamorphopsia in her left eye, describing a persistent dark spot while reading and intermittent shimmering flashes. Symptoms began abruptly after a self-limited febrile upper respiratory illness two weeks earlier. She notes mild subjective blurring, decreased contrast sensitivity and subtle color desaturation on the affected side but no periocular pain or photophobia. She has occasional migraine with visual aura historically, which she says feels different. She denies trauma, flashes of hundreds of floaters, or systemic neurologic deficits. On review, she reports difficulty focusing at near and transient oscillopsia when changing gaze. The presentation suggests a macular or retinal ischemic/inflammatory process such as acute macular neuroretinopathy, warranting urgent retinal and OCT evaluation."
P0035,"A 15-year-old female presents with three weeks of progressively worse morning headaches described as a constant pressure with intermittent throbbing, worse when bending or with Valsalva. Headaches are associated with brief transient visual obscurations and intermittent blurred vision; she also notes a bilateral pulsatile tinnitus and nausea with two episodes of emesis. Over the past five days she has developed binocular horizontal diplopia and has difficulty sustaining reading at school. She reports a 20–25 pound weight gain over the last six months but no head trauma, fever, or drug use. Ophthalmology exam demonstrated bilateral optic disc swelling, raising concern for increased intracranial pressure and possible idiopathic intracranial hypertension."
P0036,"A 25-year-old man presents with sudden onset right-sided pleuritic chest pain and acute shortness of breath after three days of a dry cough and mild sore throat. He notes a forceful coughing spell the morning symptoms began, followed by sharp, localized pain worse with inspiration and shallow breathing. He also reports lightheadedness and decreased exercise tolerance over the last 24 hours. He is a current smoker and describes a tall, thin build. At home he noticed diminished breath sounds on the right and a brief episode of palpitations. No hemoptysis or leg swelling. Prior to this he had a self-limited upper respiratory infection. He is otherwise healthy with no chronic lung disease or recent trauma."
P0037,
P0038,"A 16-year-old male high-school athlete presents with sudden-onset left-sided pleuritic chest pain and progressive shortness of breath that began halfway through basketball practice last evening. Pain is sharp, worse with deep inspiration and coughing, and associated with an intermittent dry cough and lightheadedness with exertion. He reports a week of nasal congestion and sore throat that largely resolved, and admits to occasional vaping but denies illicit drug use. Symptoms were abrupt after a jump, worsened overnight, and he now notes decreased exercise tolerance. He has no known cardiac disease but recalls childhood wheezing managed intermittently without daily therapy. He is tall and slim. He denies fever, leg swelling, or recent trauma; parents brought him for increasing dyspnea and persistent pleuritic pain."
P0039,"A 3-week-old male infant with 48 hours of progressive cough and increased work of breathing, noted after a household exposure to an older sibling with a ""cold."" Parents report persistent rhinorrhea, intermittent low-grade fever, and markedly decreased oral intake with fewer wet diapers. At home they observed rapid breathing and brief desaturations with feeding and crying. On arrival he is tachypneic with nasal flaring, subcostal and intercostal retractions, diffuse expiratory wheeze and scattered crackles; pulse oximetry low 88–92% on room air, improving with supplemental blow-by oxygen. No prior NICU stay; term vaginal delivery. Concern centers on viral bronchiolitis causing respiratory distress and hypoxemia, with feeding intolerance as a secondary issue."
P0040,
P0041,"A 38-year-old male reports two days of progressive left-sided neck pain and an intense ipsilateral throbbing headache that began during a vigorous yoga session. Several hours after onset he developed sudden right arm and leg weakness and new difficulty finding words; the deficit fluctuated but did not fully resolve. He also noticed left eyelid droop and a smaller left pupil when he checked a mirror. He has a prior history of migraine and a ten–pack-year smoking history. He recalls a sharp neck twist during a pose but no major trauma. Yesterday he experienced brief right-hand numbness. The picture is concerning for left cervical arterial dissection with focal ischemia; he denies fever, visual loss, or recent infection."
P0042,"A 1-year-old male presents with three days of intermittent, severe abdominal pain characterized by sudden episodes of inconsolable crying and drawing up of the legs. Caregiver notes recurrent non-bilious vomiting and one passage of dark, mucus‑streaked stool yesterday. There has been markedly decreased oral intake and fewer wet diapers over the past 24 hours with increasing lethargy between pain episodes. A two-week history of mild rhinorrhea preceded the abdominal symptoms. During a recent pain spell the caregiver palpated a transient, firm “sausage‑shaped” mass in the right upper quadrant. No chronic medical problems. Parents are most concerned about progressive dehydration and possible intussusception given the colicky pain, bloody stool, and palpable mass."
P0043,"A 45-year-old man reports six months of progressive postprandial epigastric pain radiating to the back. The pain is a constant, gnawing discomfort, worse after fatty meals and associated with bloating and intermittent nausea. Over the same period he notes greasy, foul-smelling stools and unintentional weight loss consistent with steatorrhea and malabsorption. He had a prior episode of acute pancreatitis and drinks alcohol daily. Outpatient evaluation recently documented fasting hyperglycemia and increased thirst. An earlier abdominal CT reportedly demonstrated pancreatic calcifications. He denies hematemesis or jaundice. He is concerned about worsening nutrition and new glucose intolerance and requests further evaluation for chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency."
P0044,"A 27-year-old woman presents with four days of progressive shortness of breath, most noticeable with minimal exertion, accompanied by a new sharp, right-sided pleuritic chest pain that began two days ago. She reports a dry cough and intermittent low-grade fevers but denies sputum production. She noticed right calf swelling and tenderness last week. She also describes occasional palpitations and lightheadedness when climbing stairs. She started a combined oral contraceptive three months ago and has a history of mild intermittent asthma managed with occasional inhaler use. Symptoms are unrelieved by rest and have worsened over several days, prompting concern for a thromboembolic event versus pneumonia; she has no recent travel or immobilization."
P0045,
P0046,"A 21-year-old female reports five days of progressive blurring of vision in the right eye, now with a central scotoma and decreased color perception. She describes dull retro-orbital pain that worsens with eye movement and a subjective feverish prodrome two weeks earlier. Symptoms intensify transiently with heat or exercise, and she notes new generalized fatigue and intermittent paresthesias of the feet over the past week. She has a remote history of migraine headaches but says this visual loss is qualitatively different, not preceded by her usual aura. No recent head trauma, no topical exposures, and no current medications. She is worried about an inflammatory optic neuropathy given the painful vision loss and associated neurologic symptoms."
P0047,"A 78-year-old woman reports acute loss of vision in the right eye after two weeks of progressive blurring and intermittent transient darkening over several minutes. This morning the vision failed completely; she also developed a new, severe right temporal headache and jaw claudication with chewing. She notes scalp tenderness when combing her hair and one-month history of morning stiffness in shoulders and hips with decreased energy and low-grade fevers. On brief exam the right optic disc appeared pale and swollen with an afferent pupillary defect. Primary care obtained inflammatory markers that were markedly elevated and referred urgently for suspected giant cell arteritis causing an ischemic optic neuropathy. No recent trauma, eye pain, or systemic rash reported."
P0048,
P0049,
P0050,"A 54-year-old female presents with new-onset persistent palpitations and progressive tremor. Palpitations began three days ago as episodic and now feel constant; she reports associated heat intolerance, a 10-pound unintentional weight loss over eight weeks, increased frequency of loose stools, and difficulty sleeping. She notes intermittent lightheadedness and exertional dyspnea walking a block. Past history is notable only for well-controlled hypertension managed without medication. On review she endorses worsening anxiety, fine hand tremor, and subtle eye irritation with lid retraction and intermittent diplopia. Symptoms began after a recent upper respiratory illness and have steadily escalated; she denies chest pain, fever, or focal weakness."
P0051,
P0052,"A 66-year-old woman presents with three weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and new sharp, right-sided pleuritic chest pain that began two days ago. She reports a change from her baseline chronic productive cough—thicker yellow sputum—and two episodes of scant hemoptysis. Symptoms worsened after a prolonged car trip and she noticed left calf swelling and aching over the past week. At baseline she has known COPD with a 40 pack-year smoking history, and treated hypertension. She describes tachycardia and near-syncope with minimal exertion and notes oxygen saturation falls with walking. The temporal sequence—immobilization then unilateral calf swelling followed by acute pleuritic pain and worsening hypoxia—raises concern for pulmonary embolism superimposed on chronic obstructive lung disease."
P0053,"A 65-year-old man reports nine months of progressive exertional dyspnea and a chronic productive cough that has acutely worsened after a recent upper respiratory infection. He notes daily mucoid sputum, marked reduction in exercise tolerance—now limited to short household tasks—and an unintentional 7-kg weight loss. On prior exam he had bibasilar ""velcro"" inspiratory crackles and early digital clubbing. He is a former heavy smoker with a 40 pack-year history who quit about a decade ago. Chest CT obtained several months ago showed basilar reticulation with early honeycombing consistent with fibrotic interstitial lung disease. He denies chest pain or hemoptysis but reports more frequent nighttime cough and worse breathlessness with minimal exertion."
P0054,"A 39-year-old woman reports a two-month history of progressive right leg weakness and intermittent numbness that began in the feet and ascended to the thigh, now causing frequent tripping. She describes electric-shock sensations with neck flexion and daily fatigue limiting work tolerance. Over the past three weeks she has had intermittent binocular diplopia and episodic blurred vision with mild retro-orbital pain on eye movement. She also notes new urinary urgency without dysuria and occasional constipation. Symptoms are fluctuating but have steadily worsened, with a recent episode of increased spasticity in the right lower extremity producing a stiff, unsteady gait. No recent head trauma; she recalls a brief upper respiratory illness six weeks before onset. Findings raise concern for an inflammatory demyelinating process."
P0055,
P0056,"A 97-year-old female presents with five days of progressively worsening dyspnea and productive cough following a witnessed choking episode while eating. Family reports low-grade fevers, decreased appetite, and purulent sputum; she has become more lethargic and requires assistance for transfers. Onset of palpitations yesterday correlated with an irregularly irregular pulse at home. She is more hypoxic than baseline, with increased oxygen requirement and orthopnea overnight. Exam reportedly notable for right lower lobe crackles and mild bilateral ankle edema. No reported chest pain or frank hemoptysis. Past baseline includes limited mobility but independent cognition. The picture is most consistent with aspiration pneumonia complicated by hypoxemic respiratory failure and new atrial fibrillation; worsening volume status and decreased oral intake are contributing."
P0057,"A 45-year-old woman presents with three weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea that has intensified over the past 48 hours, now limiting walking across a room. Two days ago she developed sharp, right-sided pleuritic chest pain and one episode of scant hemoptysis. She reports a 10-hour long-haul flight four weeks ago and progressive right calf swelling with tenderness for the past week. She describes intermittent palpitations and mild lightheadedness but denies fever or productive cough. Past medical history notable for intermittent mild asthma and treated hypothyroidism. Symptoms are most consistent with possible thromboembolic disease with secondary pulmonary compromise; she is concerned about deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and sought urgent evaluation."
P0058,
P0059,"A 43-year-old male presents with a 10-day history of cough that became worse over the past 48 hours with new exertional dyspnea, pleuritic right-sided chest pain, and scant hemoptysis. He describes the cough as initially dry then streaked with blood, and reports subjective fever and fatigue. Symptoms acutely intensified two days after a long-haul flight one week ago; he also notes recent right calf swelling and intermittent palpitations. He has a childhood history of mild intermittent asthma but no chronic COPD. He denies intravenous drug use. The combination of acute dyspnea, pleuritic pain, hemoptysis, and unilateral leg swelling raises concern for pulmonary embolism, though infectious pneumonia remains in the differential."
P0060,"A 98-year-old man presents with ten days of progressive exertional dyspnea and a purulent productive cough that acutely worsened over the past 48 hours with new resting shortness of breath. He reports low‑grade fevers, intermittent chills, and recent decreased appetite after a preceding upper respiratory illness two weeks ago. Background includes long‑standing COPD with prior CT evidence of bronchiectasis and a history of remote tobacco use. He endorses occasional choking with thin liquids and recent increased sputum volumes consistent with possible aspiration. At home caregivers noted greater confusion and two pillow orthopnea; exam shows dependent leg swelling and scattered wheeze with bibasilar crackles. He is more limited than baseline and requires supplemental oxygen at rest."
P0061,"A 24-year-old female reports a 48-hour history of progressive blurred vision in the right eye, describing a central gray spot and colors appearing washed out. Eye movement provokes a sharp, retro-orbital ache and she notes mild photophobia. She also describes transient numbness and tingling in the left fingertips over the past week and new fatigue with exertion. Symptoms began after a self-limited upper respiratory illness two weeks ago. On exam at urgent care she was noted to have an afferent pupillary defect on the right and slowed color naming compared with the left. She denies trauma, eye discharge, fever, or prior ocular surgery. There is no history of systemic autoimmune disease or diabetes. She is concerned about sudden vision loss."
P0062,"A 25-year-old male reports progressive right-sided facial weakness for five days, beginning after a painful vesicular eruption in the right external auditory canal. The facial droop worsened over 48 hours and he now has inability to fully close the right eye, drooling, and decreased taste on the anterior tongue. He describes marked sensitivity to sound in the affected ear and intermittent vertical dizziness with brief spinning episodes. Otalgia preceded the rash; he notes mild ipsilateral tinnitus but denies limb weakness, dysarthria, or recent head trauma. He recalls childhood varicella but no recent travel or immunosuppression. Review of systems otherwise notable only for dry eye on the right and low-grade subjective fever during the prodrome."
P0063,
P0064,"A 84-year-old male reports a six-week history of progressive exertional dyspnea and persistent dry cough, initially milder after a bronchitic illness two months ago but steadily worse. He notes markedly reduced exercise tolerance, needing to stop after short walks, and new exertional desaturation on stairs. Wife describes occasional nocturnal cough but he denies fever or pleuritic chest pain. At home he developed increasing work of breathing and dependent pitting edema over the past week. Past history notable for hypertension and a remote 30-pack-year smoking history. On brief review he has bibasilar inspiratory crackles and mild digital clubbing and reports an unintended five-pound weight loss. Concern is evolving interstitial lung disease with early right-heart strain versus a chronic obstructive process."
P0065,"A 55-year-old man presents with six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent cough that began after a presumed viral upper respiratory infection. Initially dry, the cough became intermittently productive; he noted scant blood-streaking last week. He describes new pleuritic right-sided chest pain with deep inspiration and a 4-kg unintentional weight loss accompanied by drenching night sweats and low-grade fevers. He completed a short antibiotic course without improvement. Past history is notable for treated hypertension and a 30–pack-year smoking history, quit five years ago. There is no history of COPD or recent travel. Review of systems otherwise negative. He is concerned given the progressive breathlessness and systemic symptoms."
P0066,
P0067,"A 14-year-old male reports a two-month history of progressive occipital headaches described as pressure-like and throbbing, characteristically worse with exertion, coughing, and bending forward. Episodes last several hours and are most severe in the morning, disrupting sleep. He endorses intermittent transient visual blurring and occasional double vision during the worst headaches. Parents report recent mild unsteadiness when running and intermittent numbness and tingling in both hands after prolonged activity. He had a sports-related concussion about six months ago that initially resolved, and he now notes new neck stiffness without fever or infectious symptoms. No prior history of migraine; no obvious trigger other than physical exertion. Symptoms have been gradually worsening, prompting neurologic evaluation."
P0068,"A 27-year-old male presents with sudden-onset right-sided pleuritic chest pain and progressive shortness of breath that began two hours ago while lifting at the gym. The pain is sharp, worsens with inspiration, and is accompanied by an acute dry cough after a week of upper respiratory symptoms. He is a current smoker with a tall, slender body habitus and denies trauma. En route he felt lightheaded and palpitations; EMS documented tachycardia and mild hypoxemia. On exam he reports decreased breath sounds over the right hemithorax without focal neurologic deficits. He has no prior pulmonary disease. Concern is for spontaneous right pneumothorax; a chest radiograph was obtained and he remains hemodynamically stable."
P0069,"A 96-year-old female reports two weeks of progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion and new orthopnea. Symptoms began after a brief upper respiratory illness with nasal congestion and low-grade fever and evolved into a persistent, mainly nonproductive cough. Family notes episodes of oxygen desaturation with minimal activity and increased work of breathing when ambulating. She has had occasional choking with thin liquids over the past month. At home she has noted swelling of both ankles and now sleeps propped up on pillows. Her past history is notable for hypertension. Prior examination documented bibasilar crackles. The clinical picture raises concern for a heart-failure exacerbation contributing to hypoxemia, with aspiration risk as a possible contributor to her respiratory decline."
P0070,"An 88-year-old man presents with three weeks of progressive gait instability and intermittent frontal headaches. Family reports gradual cognitive slowing with recent episodes of urinary urgency and one brief spell of confusion. Two weeks ago he had a ground-level fall without loss of consciousness; since then the shuffling, balance loss, and a new broad-based gait have worsened. He also experienced a transient episode of left arm numbness and mild dysarthria lasting about 20 minutes. Past history notable for hypertension and atrial fibrillation, and he remains anticoagulated. Examination by his PCP documented slowed mentation and postural instability. Differential includes normal-pressure hydrocephalus versus a chronic subdural hematoma related to anticoagulation, with consideration of small-vessel ischemic change contributing to symptoms."
P0071,A 26-year-old female presents with three days of progressive shortness of breath and pleuritic right-sided chest pain. Symptoms began after a week of persistent productive cough and wheeze she attributed to seasonal bronchitis but acutely worsened following a four-hour flight. She reports scant hemoptysis and intermittent palpitations; the sudden dyspnea prompted urgent evaluation. At home she developed mild right calf swelling and tenderness. She uses combined oral contraceptives and has a remote history of childhood asthma. There is low-grade fever and nocturnal cough but no other recent immobilization. Symptoms are worse with exertion and deep inspiration and partially relieved by sitting upright. No prior thrombotic events.
P0072,"A 41-year-old man presents with five days of progressive exertional dyspnea and new pleuritic right-sided chest pain that acutely worsened this morning. He describes a small amount of blood-tinged sputum and intermittent lightheadedness but denies fever. Symptoms began two days after a transcontinental flight during which he noted mild right calf aching; the calf is now visibly swollen and tender. He reports resting tachycardia and shortness of breath on minimal exertion. Past medical history is notable for well-controlled hypertension and a 20–pack-year smoking history; he takes no anticoagulants. No prior thromboembolic events. He is concerned the constellation—recent immobilization, unilateral leg swelling, hemoptysis, and tachycardia—represents a pulmonary embolic event."
P0073,"A 51-year-old man presents with ten days of progressively blurred central vision in the left eye, describing a new central scotoma and metamorphopsia that make reading small print difficult. He notes intermittent bright flashes (photopsias) and decreased color saturation but denies eye pain or discharge. Symptoms began one week after a short course of oral corticosteroids for bronchitis. He has well-controlled hypertension on lifestyle measures and reports intermittent tension-type headaches without focal neurologic deficits. On recent outpatient exam he was noted to have a shallow serous macular detachment on dilated fundus inspection. No prior ocular surgery or history of diabetic eye disease. He is anxious about sudden vision loss and seeks urgent evaluation for possible central serous chorioretinopathy."
P0074,"A 75-year-old man presents with progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough that have worsened over the past three months, with notable decline in exercise tolerance and a 10-pound unintentional weight loss. He reports intermittent low-grade fevers and increased breathlessness after a recent upper respiratory illness. Exam notes bibasilar inspiratory crackles and mild digital clubbing; he desaturates with minimal exertion. Past medical history includes well-controlled hypertension and a remote 30 pack-year smoking history. He was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis approximately a year ago and has had more frequent bronchitic infections recently. No chest pain, orthopnea, or leg swelling reported. He is concerned about progression and reduced ability to manage activities of daily living."
P0075,"A 90-year-old woman presents with six months of progressive gait instability and new urinary urgency, with intermittent leakage over the past two months. Family notes gradual short-term memory loss, slowed speech, and reduced initiation for several months, and she has had two falls in the last three weeks after an episode of symptomatic urinary tract infection that seemed to precipitate worsening mobility. On exam she demonstrates a broad-based, short-stepped “magnetic” gait and mild apathy with slowed recall. No focal limb weakness is reported. Past medical history includes long-standing hypertension. The constellation of gait difficulty, cognitive decline, and urinary dysfunction has raised concern for possible normal-pressure hydrocephalus versus overlapping mobility impairment from deconditioning; outpatient neuroimaging and cognition testing are requested."
P0076,"A 52-year-old man reports ten days of progressively worsening exertional dyspnea and three days of sharp, pleuritic right-sided chest pain. He noticed scant hemoptysis yesterday and intermittent palpitations with exertion. Symptoms began after a 10-hour flight two weeks ago, since when his right calf has been intermittently swollen and tender. He describes near-syncope with climbing stairs and now limits activity because of breathlessness. He has a prior provoked deep venous thrombosis several years earlier and a 30-pack-year smoking history. He denies fevers or sputum production and has had no recent surgeries. He is anxious about the breathing difficulty but reports good baseline exercise tolerance before this started and is concerned about possible pulmonary embolism."
P0077,"A 97-year-old female reports six weeks of progressive gait instability, initially mild stumbling now described as a shuffling, magnetic gait with two recent falls and difficulty initiating steps. Family notes new short-term memory loss and slowed processing, and she has developed urinary urgency with occasional daytime incontinence over the same interval. Symptoms evolved insidiously rather than after an acute event; she denies focal weakness or headache but endorses brief lightheadedness on standing. Past medical history notable for long-standing hypertension without prior stroke. Recent outpatient noncontrast head CT reportedly showed ventriculomegaly. On exam she demonstrates postural instability and bradyphrenia. Presentation raises concern for normal-pressure hydrocephalus versus a degenerative gait disorder; plan includes neurology evaluation and consideration of diagnostic high-volume lumbar puncture."
P0078,"An 11-year-old boy presents with a two-week history of persistent cough and new exertional wheeze after a brief viral upper respiratory illness. Initial rhinorrhea and sore throat resolved, but a dry day- and night-time cough has persisted, with worsening nocturnal cough wakes two to three times nightly. He reports shortness of breath and chest tightness when running during soccer practices and a clear audible wheeze heard by parents. There have been intermittent low-grade fevers but no vomiting or hemoptysis. Past history is notable for seasonal allergic rhinitis and childhood atopic dermatitis; no prior hospitalizations for breathing problems. Symptoms partially abate with rest and are worse with cold air and exercise, suggesting post-infectious airway hyperreactivity or new-onset asthma. Family history is notable for parental allergy."
P0079,"A 52-year-old man presents with ten days of progressive exertional dyspnea that began after a brief upper respiratory illness; breathlessness has worsened over the past four days and is now provoked by walking one flight. He describes a sharp, pleuritic right-sided chest pain that increases with deep inspiration and a single episode of scant hemoptysis yesterday. He reports intermittent palpitations and subjective lightheadedness but denies fever. Five days ago he noticed swelling and mild ache in his right calf after a long car trip. He is a former 20 pack-year smoker with well-controlled hypertension. On exertion he becomes noticeably breathless and uses shallow respirations. The constellation suggests possible venous thromboembolism with secondary pulmonary involvement rather than simple postinfectious cough."
P0080,"A 27-year-old male cook presents with four days of progressively worsening right upper quadrant abdominal pain that began as brief biliary colic after a fatty meal and has become constant and deep. He reports associated fevers with intermittent rigors, nausea with several episodes of non-bloody vomiting, and progressive jaundice noticed by yellowing of his eyes. He also describes dark urine and generalized pruritus over the past 48 hours. He recalls an ultrasound years ago that documented gallstones and prior transient postprandial colic. He denies recent travel, antibiotic use, or significant alcohol intake. Pain limits oral intake and he feels more fatigued than usual; he is concerned about an infected or obstructing gallstone and wants urgent evaluation."
P0081,"An 87-year-old man presents with six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough that began after a self-limited bronchitic illness. He notes gradual 5-kg weight loss and increasing fatigue; over the past week he has desaturated to the mid-80s on short walks and developed occasional scant hemoptysis. He has a two-year history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with baseline reduced exercise tolerance, and now reports worsening crackling breath sounds at the bases and new digital clubbing. He has chronic atrial fibrillation and hypertension but no chest pain or orthopnea. He denies sputum purulence or fever since the initial illness. The pattern is concerning for acute exacerbation of pulmonary fibrosis with superimposed hypoxemia and functional decline."
P0082,
P0083,"A 9-year-old boy presents with a two-week history of progressively worsening cough and shortness of breath, most notable with exertion. Symptoms began after a recent upper respiratory infection and now include frequent nocturnal coughing that wakes him and a sensation of chest tightness with running; parents report audible wheeze during play and markedly reduced exercise tolerance, causing him to skip soccer practice. He had no high fevers, no significant sputum production, and no vomiting. Past history is notable for seasonal allergic rhinitis. Symptoms partially improve with rest but recur with minimal activity. Examination and history raise concern for post-viral airway hyperresponsiveness or new-onset reactive airways disease with exercise-induced bronchospasm."
P0084,"A 49-year-old man presents with an eight-week history of progressive swallowing difficulty, initially with solids and now with liquids, accompanied by frequent regurgitation of undigested food and increasing halitosis. He notes nocturnal coughing and occasional choking episodes, and developed low-grade fever and productive cough after one severe episode two weeks ago. He reports a 10-pound unintentional weight loss and intermittent nonpleuritic retrosternal discomfort. Past history includes chronic reflux symptoms treated intermittently and a remote smoking history. Exam has been notable to him for new hoarseness and early satiety. The temporal pattern and combined solid/liquid dysphagia with regurgitation raise concern for an esophageal motility disorder such as achalasia, with possible aspiration-related bronchitis."
P0085,
P0086,"An 88-year-old female presents with acute right-sided weakness and slurred speech that began two days ago after waking. Family reports right facial droop, intermittent choking on liquids, and an unwitnessed fall at home with new gait instability. Over the past 48 hours she developed fluctuating confusion and reduced oral intake; relatives note she was treated for a urinary tract infection last week. Past medical history includes hypertension and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Brief exam in clinic showed marked right upper and lower extremity weakness with expressive language impairment. Noncontrast head CT in the emergency department demonstrated a new left MCA territory cortical infarct consistent with an embolic stroke. She denies headache, fever, or recent trauma."
P0087,"A 74-year-old woman presents with five days of progressive exertional dyspnea and pleuritic right-sided chest pain. Symptoms began about two weeks after elective knee arthroplasty with a prolonged period of limited ambulation; she reports new right calf swelling and tenderness that started a week ago. She has a dry cough and intermittent lightheadedness with exertion, and family members noted episodic rapid pulse rates at home. She describes intermittent low-grade fevers and exertional oxygen desaturation. Past medical history includes hypertension and osteoarthritis. She denies hemoptysis or recent long-distance travel. She is increasingly limited by breathlessness and decreased exercise tolerance, raising concern for postoperative venous thromboembolism versus deconditioning or concurrent cardiopulmonary disease."
P0088,"A 37-year-old man presents with two days of acute right-sided pleuritic chest pain and progressive exertional dyspnea. The pain is sharp, worse with deep inspiration, and he notes one small episode of bright red hemoptysis. Symptoms began shortly after a long commercial flight a week ago; he also developed new right calf swelling and aching over the same interval. He reports intermittent palpitations and lightheadedness and notes his home pulse oximeter has been lower than usual. Past history includes mild intermittent asthma and obesity; he smokes about half a pack daily. He denies fever, recent upper respiratory infection, or trauma. Given the constellation of unilateral calf edema, pleuritic pain, tachycardia, hypoxia, and hemoptysis, he is concerned about a possible venous thromboembolism."

P0090,
P0091,"A 62-year-old female reports abrupt, painless loss of vision in her left eye that began on waking six hours ago. She describes near-complete central blurring with a gray curtain and denies eye pain, photophobia, or floaters. She notes two brief, transient episodes of monocular dimming over the past week. Past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and intermittent palpitations suggestive of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Exam in clinic revealed a left afferent pupillary defect and fundoscopic retinal whitening with a cherry-red spot. Carotid bruits are audible on auscultation. She denies recent trauma, temporal headache, jaw claudication, or systemic illness. She is anxious about sudden permanent loss and requests urgent vascular and retinal evaluation."
P0092,
P0093,"A 59-year-old male presents with sudden-onset pleuritic right-sided chest pain and progressive dyspnea that began two days after a prolonged 10-hour car trip. He describes sharp pain worse with inspiration, associated with intermittent small-volume hemoptysis and a dry cough. Over 48 hours he developed subjective fevers and increasing shortness of breath with minimal exertion. He has known COPD managed with an occasional rescue inhaler and long-standing hypertension. At home he noted palpitations and low oxygen levels, and today reports new right calf swelling and tenderness. There is growing concern for pulmonary embolism versus COPD exacerbation, prompting urgent evaluation; he denies prior thromboembolic disease."
P0094,
P0095,"A 50-year-old man presents with two weeks of progressive blurred central vision in the right eye, culminating yesterday in a sudden superior visual field defect. He also reports intermittent diplopia and increased photophobia. Concurrently he developed a new, constant right temporal headache with overlying scalp tenderness and jaw claudication when chewing, which prompted urgent evaluation. He endorses six weeks of morning shoulder stiffness and aching suggestive of proximal myalgia, along with fatigue and low-grade fever. No eye pain, trauma, or prior ocular surgery. Past medical history notable for well-controlled hypertension. Symptoms suggest an inflammatory arteritic process with probable ischemic optic neuropathy; he is concerned about further vision loss and seeks urgent assessment."
P0096,"A 30-year-old man reports three days of progressive dyspnea and sharp right-sided pleuritic chest pain that began shortly after a prolonged transcontinental flight. Initially worse with exertion, shortness of breath is now present at rest and associated with intermittent palpitations and lightheadedness. He developed a productive cough with scant blood-tinged sputum and low-grade subjective fever. He also notes new swelling and tenderness of the right calf over the past 48 hours. Past history is notable only for childhood asthma; he is a current smoker without chronic inhaler use. He denies recent trauma or bleeding disorders. The temporal clustering of immobilization, unilateral calf pain, pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis, and tachycardic symptoms raises concern for acute venous thromboembolism with possible pulmonary infarction versus infectious pneumonia."
P0097,"A 22-year-old female reports five days of progressive blurring of vision in the left eye, accompanied by dull periorbital discomfort and sharp pain with eye movement. She notes colors look “washed out” on the affected side and intermittent photopsias; visual acuity feels markedly reduced compared with baseline. Symptoms began after a brief viral upper respiratory illness about ten days earlier and worsen with heat or exertion (Uhthoff-like phenomenon). Over the past two weeks she has also had intermittent paresthesias in the right hand and occasional distal lower extremity numbness. She has a history of episodic migraines but describes the current visual change as distinct. No head trauma, nausea, or fever currently. Family history significant for autoimmune thyroid disease."
P0098,"A 37-year-old female reports ten days of progressive right-sided numbness and tingling with increasing unsteadiness on her feet and intermittent horizontal diplopia. Symptoms began after a brief febrile upper respiratory illness and have worsened over the past week; she now notices electric shock–like sensations down the spine with neck flexion and urinary urgency developing over several days. She describes prior ocular pain with eye movement and a diagnosed episode of optic neuritis about a year ago. Fatigue is prominent and exacerbates cognitive fog in the afternoons. On review she denies chest pain or recent trauma. The pattern—multifocal sensory deficits, gait ataxia, visual disturbance, Lhermitte phenomenon following a recent infection—raises concern for a demyelinating process rather than peripheral neuropathy."
P0099,"A 46-year-old male presents with eight weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a daily productive cough. He describes intermittent right-sided pleuritic chest pain, occasional scant hemoptysis, and an unintentional 15-pound weight loss accompanied by night sweats. Symptoms were insidious but noticeably worsened after a prolonged ten-hour car trip one month ago; he also reports intermittent right calf swelling and aching since then. He is a current smoker with a 20-pack-year history and has had recurrent bronchitic illnesses in prior years. He denies high fevers but notes fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance. The new hemoptysis and systemic symptoms raise concern for an underlying pulmonary neoplasm or chronic infection, while the recent immobilization and calf symptoms suggest possible DVT with pulmonary embolism."
P0100,"A 67-year-old man presents with nine months of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough, with a marked decline over the past three weeks following a presumed upper respiratory infection. He reports limited walking tolerance now, frequent stopping for breath, and a roughly 8-pound unintentional weight loss. On exertion he notes lightheadedness and subjective oxygen desaturation. Exam at the clinic revealed bibasilar fine inspiratory crackles and mild digital clubbing. He is a 40–pack-year ex-smoker and denies chest pain or orthopnea. No known prior heart failure. Clinical concern is for evolving interstitial lung disease, possibly idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, with superimposed postinfectious worsening; referral for high-resolution chest imaging and pulmonary function testing was discussed."
P0101,"An 85-year-old man presents with three months of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough that began after a winter bronchitis. Shortness of breath initially occurred with hills but now limits walking across the house; he also notes two-pillow orthopnea and mild bilateral ankle swelling. Family reports a five-pound unintentional weight loss and occasional low-grade fevers. Exam findings at clinic include bibasilar fine inspiratory crackles and early digital clubbing. He is a former 40-pack-year smoker with no recent travel. Symptoms suggest an insidious interstitial process with superimposed deconditioning; differential includes evolving pulmonary fibrosis versus organizing pneumonia, with concurrent volume redistribution contributing to edema and orthopnea. He denies hemoptysis or chest pain. Further pulmonary evaluation recommended."

P0903,"A 78-year-old woman presents with two weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a dry cough, with acute worsening over the past 48 hours characterized by pleuritic left-sided chest discomfort and a scant episode of hemoptysis. She reports new intermittent palpitations and notes increasing swelling and tightness in her right calf that began after a recent week of limited mobility following a minor fall at home. At baseline she has well-controlled hypertension and chronic osteoarthritis. She felt lightheaded with exertion yesterday and measured home oxygen saturation in the high 80s on ambulation. No fever or sputum production. The temporal clustering of immobility, unilateral leg swelling, hypoxemia, pleuritic pain, and hemoptysis raises concern for possible pulmonary embolism."
P0904,"A 95-year-old female reports sudden, progressive loss of vision in the right eye over 48 hours, preceded by two weeks of new temporal headache and scalp tenderness. She describes jaw claudication while eating and low-grade fevers with notable morning stiffness and shoulder girdle aching consistent with polymyalgia-like symptoms. On presentation family noted the right pupil reacted sluggishly and she has markedly decreased visual acuity in that eye. Past medical history includes long-standing hypertension and osteoarthritis; she lives at home with assistance. Concern is high for giant cell (temporal) arteritis given the constellation of monocular visual loss, focal scalp tenderness, jaw pain, proximal muscle stiffness, and elevated inflammatory markers reported on preliminary testing. No recent trauma, infection, or new medications."
P0905,
P0906,"A 25-year-old female reports two days of progressively worsening right upper quadrant abdominal pain, sharp and steady, radiating to the right scapula and reliably provoked after fatty meals. She describes associated postprandial nausea with two episodes of nonbloody emesis and low-grade fevers. Over the same period she has noted new yellowing of her eyes and skin with dark urine. She also complains of intense pruritus and decreased appetite. She has a history of intermittent biliary colic over the past year but no prior abdominal surgery. She denies alcohol use or recent travel. The temporal sequence—postprandial pain followed by jaundice and fever—raises concern for choledocholithiasis with possible ascending cholangitis."
P0907,
P0908,"A 58-year-old man presents with one week of progressively worsening exertional dyspnea and a new, sharp right-sided pleuritic chest pain. He reports increased productive cough with yellow-green sputum and intermittent low-grade fevers following a viral upper respiratory illness. He has a remote 40–pack-year smoking history and known COPD that had been stable until this episode. Three days ago he completed a long car trip and noted mild right calf swelling and cramping. He also describes brief lightheadedness when climbing stairs and difficulty sleeping unless propped up. He denies frank hemoptysis but feels more fatigued than usual. Past medical history includes hypertension. He is concerned this represents either an infectious COPD exacerbation or possible pulmonary embolism given the unilateral leg swelling and new pleuritic pain."
P0909,"A 25-year-old woman presents with progressive daily headaches for six weeks, described as diffuse pressure worse in the mornings and with Valsalva. Headaches are accompanied by transient visual obscurations and intermittent horizontal diplopia on lateral gaze, and she reports a rhythmic whooshing in both ears consistent with pulsatile tinnitus. She notes associated nausea and photophobia but denies fever or recent head trauma. Ophthalmology documented bilateral optic disc swelling at an urgent visit. Symptoms began after a three-month period of rapid weight gain and worsening irregular menses; she carries a prior diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome. No personal history of migraine or anticoagulant use."

P0913,"A 46-year-old man reports six weeks of progressive epigastric pain that intermittently radiates to the mid-back, classically worse after meals and limiting his appetite. He describes bulky, foul-smelling stools and oily spotting on the toilet for the past month, with an unintended ten-pound weight loss. Over the same interval he has had intermittent low-grade fevers and malaise. During the last week he noticed yellowing of his eyes, dark urine, and pale, clay-colored stools, prompting concern for obstructive jaundice. He has a remote history of heavy alcohol binges but drinks only occasionally now and is a former smoker. He denies hematemesis, melena, or prior gallbladder surgery. Symptoms suggest pancreatic or biliary pathology requiring further evaluation."
P0914,"An 87-year-old female reports ten days of progressive dyspnea, initially with exertion and now at rest, with increasing fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance; she now tires after a few steps. She awakened twice with sudden nighttime breathlessness and uses two pillows for sleep, and has noticed progressive bilateral ankle swelling. Three days ago she developed intermittent palpitations and lightheadedness, and family observed an irregular pulse suggestive of possible atrial fibrillation. She denies chest pain but has a persistent dry cough following a brief upper respiratory illness two weeks earlier. Past history includes hypertension, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, and known moderate aortic stenosis. Appetite is down; no fevers, hemoptysis, or focal neurologic deficits."

P0918,"A 32-year-old male software engineer presents with three days of progressive blurring and dimming of vision in the right eye, accompanied by sharp pain with extraocular movement. He reports marked desaturation of colors on the affected side and difficulty reading small print. Symptoms began one week after a self-limited upper respiratory illness with sore throat and congestion. He notes intermittent photophobia and new central floaters but denies discharge or ocular trauma. Mild retro-orbital headache and nausea without vomiting accompany episodes of vision change. On exam at urgent care he was noted to have a relative afferent pupillary defect in the right eye. No prior ophthalmologic history aside from remote myopia. Concern raised for optic neuritis versus inflammatory uveitis; urgent ophthalmology evaluation arranged."
P0919,"An 11-year-old boy presents with two days of persistent vomiting and increasing lethargy. Parents describe a two-week history of excessive thirst and urination with new nocturnal enuresis and an unexplained 5-kg weight loss. Over the past three days he developed intermittent periumbilical abdominal pain and progressive nausea with poor oral intake. Today he is drowsy at times and noted to be breathing deeply and rapidly; caregivers report a sweet, fruity odor on his breath. He has been less active and has had decreased urine output despite earlier polyuria. No medication use or recent travel. The combination of polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, vomiting, abdominal pain, Kussmaul respirations, fruity breath, and lethargy is concerning for new-onset type 1 diabetes with evolving diabetic ketoacidosis."
P0920,"A 13-year-old boy presents with five days of progressive blurring of vision in the right eye, accompanied by aching behind the eye and sharp pain with extraocular movement. He reports colors in the affected eye appear ""washed out"" and parents note he favors the left when reading. Symptoms began about one week after a febrile upper respiratory illness with sore throat and runny nose. On exam at home the family observed the right pupil to be slower to constrict than the left. He denies discharge or trauma but has felt unusually fatigued and has had intermittent fingertip tingling over the last three days. Concern is for an inflammatory optic neuropathy such as optic neuritis from a postinfectious or demyelinating process restricting his school activities."
P0921,"A 27-year-old female reports an 8-week history of progressive postprandial fullness, early satiety, and persistent nausea. Over the past month she has developed intermittent nonbilious emesis, occurring two to three times weekly, and an 8-pound unintentional weight loss because solid meals provoke worsening symptoms. The problems began after a self-limited gastroenteritis and have evolved to include marked bloating and alternating constipation. She denies fevers, hematemesis, or recent antibiotic use. Appetite is reduced and she feels increasingly fatigued. No prior abdominal surgery. She is most concerned about possible gastroparesis and is requesting evaluation for delayed gastric emptying and brief nutritional counseling to address ongoing weight loss."
P0922,"A 9-year-old boy presents with an eight-week history of exertional shortness of breath and intermittent wheeze, which began after a presumed viral upper respiratory infection. Over the past three weeks his parents have noticed progressive exercise intolerance at soccer practices with episodes of chest tightness and a sensation of throat constriction during exertion. He wakes with a nocturnal cough about twice weekly and has occasional high-pitched inspiratory noise when laughing or upset. A brief trial of an inhaled bronchodilator at urgent care gave minimal, transient relief. He has a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis with nasal congestion and sneezing, no fevers, and normal growth. Concerns are for exercise-induced bronchospasm versus vocal cord dysfunction with post-infectious cough."
P0923,"A 4-year-old boy presents with a three-day history of progressive sore throat and rhinorrhea that began after a presumed viral cold. Over 48 hours he developed fever to 39°C, increasing odynophagia and drooling with markedly reduced oral intake; parents note he refuses solids and has had only sips of fluid. Yesterday he began sleeping poorly and now speaks with a muffled “hot potato” voice and demonstrates difficulty opening his mouth. On initial evaluation there is a left-sided tonsillar bulge with uvular deviation and tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, raising concern for a peritonsillar process. He has no respiratory distress, wheeze, or ear pain, and immunizations are reported as up to date. Parents deny recent foreign body exposure."
P0924,"A 0-year-old female infant presents with 48 hours of progressive nasal congestion and noisy breathing, now with poor oral intake and fewer wet diapers. Symptoms began after an older sibling had a mild cold; she developed rhinorrhea and intermittent coughing on day one and now has audible wheeze with tachypnea and visible subcostal retractions. Caregivers report two brief self-limited pauses in breathing overnight and persistent low-grade fever. Exam by phone notes increased work of breathing and lethargy with shallow feeds. Concern is bronchiolitis, likely viral (RSV exposure suspected), with secondary dehydration from decreased intake and decreased urine output. No rash, emesis, or known congenital cardiac disease reported. Parents seek evaluation for possible oxygen support or IV fluids."
P0925,
P0926,"A 43-year-old man reports 48 hours of progressive right-sided weakness and slurred speech. Symptoms began abruptly on waking with clumsiness of the right hand that progressed to difficulty rising from a chair; he now has intermittent right facial droop and dysarthria. He describes a dull occipital headache and new unsteadiness with one ground-level fall but no loss of consciousness. He notes numbness along the right forearm and decreased grip strength. Medical history is notable for poorly controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes; he smokes and had a mild upper respiratory infection about ten days ago. Family members describe brief episodes of confusion and word-finding difficulty. He denies chest pain, fever, or recent head trauma and is worried about a cerebrovascular event."
P0927,"A 32-year-old woman reports five days of progressive dyspnea and sharp right-sided pleuritic chest pain that worsens with inspiration and cough. The cough is dry and intermittent; she notes a low-grade fever and mild palpitations with exertion and occasional lightheadedness. Symptoms began after a brief upper respiratory illness two weeks prior and acutely worsened following a long airplane flight. She takes combined oral contraceptives and is otherwise healthy with a history of mild intermittent asthma. She denies hemoptysis, calf swelling, or recent trauma but is concerned about a possible pulmonary embolism given the abrupt onset and risk factors. She has had reduced exercise tolerance and uses her rescue inhaler rarely without clear relief of the current shortness of breath."
P0928,"A 68-year-old man reports progressive exertional dyspnea and a chronic productive cough that have slowly worsened over the past year, with an acute five-day escalation of shortness of breath accompanied by new right-sided pleuritic chest pain and scant hemoptysis. He describes a 40-pack-year smoking history and has known COPD of a chronic bronchitic phenotype and hypertension. Over the past two months he notes eight pounds of unintentional weight loss and diminished exercise tolerance; the cough intermittently produces yellowish sputum but no high fevers. Symptoms intensified after a recent upper respiratory illness. Examination today is deferred, but his presentation is concerning for a COPD exacerbation versus pulmonary embolism or an underlying lung malignancy given the hemoptysis and weight loss."
P0929,"An 83-year-old woman reports two weeks of progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion and a productive cough, with increased purulent sputum and intermittent low-grade fevers following a presumed viral URI. She describes a brief choking episode while swallowing pills three days ago and now has new resting dyspnea and mild hypoxemia. Past pulmonary history is notable for COPD and known bronchiectasis; she also has long-standing hypertension. Exam-style symptoms include persistent fatigue, diminished exercise tolerance, bilateral coarse crackles, and scattered wheeze without chest pain. No focal neurologic deficits or dysphagia are reported. The presentation is most consistent with an acute-on-chronic lower respiratory infection, likely with an aspiration component superimposed on COPD/bronchiectasis."
P0930,"A 21-year-old male student presents with five days of progressive blurred vision in his right eye, associated with sharp retro-orbital pain worsened by eye movement and intermittent diplopia. He noticed color desaturation and a “gray” central spot, and his girlfriend observed the right pupil reacted sluggishly. Symptoms began after a brief viral upper respiratory illness and were preceded two weeks earlier by transient tingling in his feet and occasional electric-shock sensations with neck flexion. He denies trauma, fever, or ocular discharge. On exam he reports photophobia and difficulty reading small print. The pattern—unilateral painful visual loss with an afferent pupillary defect, dyschromatopsia, and antecedent sensory symptoms—is most consistent with optic neuritis and raises concern for a demyelinating process such as multiple sclerosis."
P0931,"A 98-year-old female reports two weeks of abrupt worsening of central vision in the left eye on a background of longstanding macular degeneration. She describes new metamorphopsia and an enlarging central scotoma with marked difficulty reading, recognizing faces, and dressing; the vision had declined slowly over years but acutely worsened when she noticed a persistent dark blot several days ago. She has known bilateral cataracts and denies ocular pain, purulent discharge, or headache. Caregivers report one near‑fall last week related to the visual change without head injury. Home assessment noted markedly reduced left central acuity. She seeks urgent ophthalmologic evaluation for suspected neovascular conversion with possible subretinal hemorrhage."
P0932,"A 19-year-old male presents with a two-week history of progressive morning headaches described as throbbing and worse with coughing or bending. Headaches began after a week of sinus congestion and purulent nasal discharge and have become daily, often accompanied by nausea and two brief episodes of non‑generalized right‑hand twitching with preserved awareness. After the second event he experienced transient right arm weakness for about 20 minutes. He also reports intermittent visual obscurations and horizontal diplopia, photophobia, and one night of vomiting; he felt febrile during the initial sinus illness but denies recent trauma. No prior seizures, no anticoagulant use, and no illicit drug use. Symptoms raise concern for intracranial hypertension or venous sinus thrombosis related to recent sinus infection."
P0933,"A 38-year-old female presents with two weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and new orthopnea, reporting awakening once nightly with breathlessness. She describes paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and a persistent nonproductive cough since a febrile viral illness three weeks ago. Over the past week she has noted increasing lower extremity swelling, intermittent palpitations, and generalized fatigue with reduced exercise tolerance; she also felt lightheaded when climbing stairs. She denies chest pain at rest but describes occasional chest tightness with exertion. No prior cardiopulmonary disease is reported. Symptoms have limited her ability to work and are clearly worse at night and with minimal exertion, raising concern for new-onset cardiomyopathy or decompensated heart failure after the recent infection."
P0934,"A 72-year-old man presents with six months of progressive gait instability characterized by a short, shuffling, magnetic-appearing step and two to three falls in the past month. The family reports new forgetfulness and slowed thinking over the same interval, with difficulty managing finances and recent episodes of urinary urgency with occasional incontinence. Symptoms insidiously began after a minor head bump last winter but have steadily worsened; walking is more difficult than climbing stairs. A recent noncontrast head CT showed ventriculomegaly without acute hemorrhage, prompting neurology referral for suspected normal-pressure hydrocephalus. Past medical history is notable for long-standing hypertension and chronic lumbar spondylosis, though back pain does not correlate with the current gait decline. He denies fever, limb numbness, or bowel dysfunction."
P0935,
P0936,"A 72-year-old woman presents with three months of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent nonproductive cough, with marked worsening over the past two weeks. She now reports orthopnea and new bilateral lower-extremity swelling, limiting her ability to climb stairs. On brief exertion she becomes dyspneic and her oxygen saturation falls into the low 80s at times. Exam at bedside reveals bibasilar fine crackles and dependent pitting edema; she denies fever, chest pain, or hemoptysis. Past history notable for long-standing hypertension and a remote ten–pack-year smoking history. The subacute course and exam raise concern for interstitial lung disease with possible chronic hypoxemic pulmonary hypertension contributing to right-sided congestion. Further pulmonary evaluation is planned."
P0937,
P0938,
P0939,"A 96-year-old female reports three days of progressive dyspnea and a new productive cough after an episode of choking while eating. Family notes increased sputum purulence and intermittent low-grade fevers since the event; she describes mild right-sided pleuritic discomfort when coughing. At baseline she has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and is more short of breath than usual. On arrival she is more tachypneic with hypoxemia on room air and audible bibasilar crackles with expiratory wheeze; there is mild dependent edema. Clinical concern is aspiration pneumonia superimposed on a COPD exacerbation precipitated by oropharyngeal dysphagia. She denies hemoptysis, calf pain, or recent travel."
P0940,"An 88-year-old man presents with six months of progressive gait instability characterized by a broad-based, shuffling, somewhat “magnetic” step and two recent falls. Family notes gradual short-term memory loss and slower speech over the same interval, with new urinary urgency progressing to occasional daytime incontinence in the past month. Symptoms markedly worsened after a urinary tract infection treated as an outpatient two weeks ago, with increased apathy and imbalance. He has a history of hypertension and long-standing benign prostatic hyperplasia, but bladder symptoms precede his recent prostatism change. Neurological exam reportedly shows slowed mentation and frontal release signs; prior head imaging demonstrated ventriculomegaly without marked cortical atrophy. Normal-pressure hydrocephalus is suspected; peripheral neuropathy is a possible contributor to his instability."
P0941,
P0942,"A 17-year-old female reports a six-week history of progressive unintentional weight loss of about 6 kg with intermittent palpitations and a fine resting tremor. She notes new heat intolerance and frequent night sweating, and over the past month her menses have become irregular and lighter. She has felt a subtle midline neck fullness that moves with swallowing and intermittent anterior neck discomfort. In the last two weeks she developed proximal thigh weakness that makes climbing stairs and carrying groceries more difficult. She also describes intermittent mild binocular horizontal diplopia when tired. Symptoms are gradually worsening, worse with activity and partially relieved by rest. No fevers, cough, or recent travel; past medical history otherwise unremarkable."
P0943,"A 90-year-old woman presents with three days of progressive dyspnea and a productive cough after a witnessed choking episode while eating. Family reports immediate coughing with small amounts of aspirated material, followed by persistent wheeze and increasing shortness of breath that is now present at rest. She has low-grade fevers and describes thicker, foul-smelling sputum. At home she has required supplemental oxygen for worsening hypoxemia and has had poor oral intake with decreased urine output. On exam she is mildly confused compared with baseline and has bibasilar crackles greater on the right. Past history notable for mild cognitive impairment and hypertension. Impression is acute aspiration pneumonia with hypoxemic respiratory compromise and dehydration."
P0944,"An 89-year-old female presents with three weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and new orthopnea, reporting two pillows to sleep and one episode of waking breathless overnight. She notes a five-pound weight gain and increasing, pitting bilateral lower extremity edema up to the knees. Symptoms began after a brief upper respiratory illness and are accompanied by a mild productive cough but no fever. She describes intermittent palpitations and fatigue limiting her baseline ambulation. Past medical history is notable for long-standing hypertension and known aortic stenosis; chronic kidney disease stage 3 has previously complicated diuretic adjustments. No chest pain or syncope. Family is managing at home but she is more dyspneic with usual activities, prompting evaluation for decompensated heart failure versus arrhythmic exacerbation."
P0945,"A 66-year-old male presents with an eight-week history of progressive dysphagia, initially to solids and now to both solids and liquids, associated with a 12-pound unintentional weight loss. He reports intermittent odynophagia and frequent regurgitation of undigested food, particularly at night, with several episodes of coughing and mild choking suggestive of nocturnal aspiration. Over the past three weeks he has developed new hoarseness and a sensation of throat fullness. He has a long history of chronic GERD and a 30-pack-year smoking history but denies hematemesis or melena. Recent outpatient labs showed iron-deficiency anemia. Symptoms are progressive rather than episodic, raising concern for an obstructive esophageal process such as malignancy versus a stricture, prompting endoscopic evaluation."
P0946,
P0947,"A 48-year-old woman presents with five days of progressively worsening right-sided pleuritic chest pain and exertional dyspnea that began after a long transcontinental flight two weeks ago. Pain is sharp, worse with deep inspiration and coughing, and associated with intermittent palpitations and mild hemoptysis. She describes prior three-day history of right calf swelling and tenderness, and notes recent lightheadedness on exertion. Symptoms are limiting her usual walking and sleep. Past medical history includes hypertension and obesity; she is a former smoker. She denies fever or recent bronchitis but reports occasional nocturnal reflux symptoms. On review, she fears a clot given the travel history; symptoms are most consistent with venous thromboembolism presenting with pulmonary complications."
P0948,
P0949,"A 67-year-old male reports four months of progressive gait instability and cognitive slowing. He describes a small‑step, magnetic shuffling gait with difficulty initiating steps and occasional mild dysarthria when fatigued; family reports two ground-level falls in the past month without loss of consciousness. Over the last six months there has been worsening short‑term memory and increased apathy, with new urinary urgency and occasional stress leakage for two months. He denies fevers, headache, or sensory loss. An outpatient head CT last month was reported to show ventricular enlargement. Past medical history notable for treated hypertension. Symptoms have insidiously progressed, and his son is concerned about steadily reduced mobility and safety at home, prompting today's evaluation for suspected communicating hydrocephalus versus neurodegenerative etiology."
P0950,
P0951,"A 21-year-old female reports a 10-day history of progressive vision loss in her left eye. She first noticed central blurring and difficulty reading; over several days this evolved into a distinct gray central scotoma and subjective color desaturation, with reds appearing washed out. She describes aching retro-orbital pain that worsens with eye movement and intermittent photophobia. Over the same week she developed mild frontal headache and brief episodes of numbness and tingling in the right hand and forearm. Symptoms began after a febrile upper respiratory illness two weeks ago. She denies ocular discharge, trauma, or diplopia. Given the painful unilateral visual decline with a recent viral prodrome, she is concerned for optic neuritis."
P0952,"A previously healthy 8-year-old boy presents with a three-week history of progressive cough and audible wheeze that began after a viral upper respiratory infection. The cough is dry, worse at night, and reliably triggered by running and cold air; parents note increasingly labored breathing with exertion and decreased stamina during play. He had low-grade fever during the first two days but has been afebrile since. At urgent care he had diffuse expiratory wheeze and mild intercostal retractions with partial relief after a nebulized bronchodilator. Past history is significant for seasonal allergic rhinitis, and maternal asthma is noted. No recent travel or known sick contacts."
P0953,
P0954,"A 40-year-old man reports three weeks of progressive, intermittent right-sided numbness and weakness that first appeared while bending to lift a box and has waxed and waned since. Episodes last several hours and are now accompanied by intermittent diplopia and blurred vision with painful eye movement, and a brief electric shock sensation down the spine when he flexes his neck. He describes new gait instability and fatigue limiting his work, plus urinary urgency without dysuria. Symptoms tend to worsen with heat and exertion. He recalls a febrile upper respiratory illness about two months ago but denies trauma, recent travel, or illicit drug use. No prior neurologic history; family history noncontributory. He seeks evaluation for a possible demyelinating process."
P0955,"A 23-year-old woman reports a six-week history of progressive, daily morning headaches described as diffuse, throbbing, and worse with lying flat or with Valsalva maneuvers. Headaches are accompanied by nausea, intermittent photophobia, and several brief episodes of transient visual obscurations — she says the vision “flashes dark” for seconds when standing. Over the past two weeks she has experienced unilateral pulsatile tinnitus and had two brief episodes of horizontal diplopia that resolved spontaneously. She notes a 15-pound weight gain in the last three months. No history of trauma, fever, or focal limb weakness. An outpatient ophthalmoscopy documented bilateral optic disc swelling, raising concern for increased intracranial pressure/idiopathic intracranial hypertension as the unifying diagnosis."
P0956,"A 23-year-old male reports five days of progressively worsening cough and right-sided pleuritic chest pain that began after a recent upper respiratory infection. The cough is now productive of yellow-green sputum with low-grade fevers and malaise; he describes exertional shortness of breath that limits his usual gym routine. He notes intermittent wheeze and a sense of chest tightness but denies syncope or leg swelling. He endorses daily e-cigarette use and works in a shared indoor environment. Past history is notable only for childhood allergic rhinitis. On self-exam he feels decreased air entry at the right base and focal pleuritic tenderness. Clinical concern is for community-acquired lobar pneumonia with superimposed bronchospasm, and he seeks evaluation for antibiotics and a bronchodilator."
P0957,"A 56-year-old woman reports eight weeks of progressive, fluctuating weakness, beginning with intermittent binocular diplopia and worsening bilateral ptosis that is most pronounced by evening. Over the past month she has developed intermittent dysphagia for solids, morning voice hoarseness, and proximal upper‑extremity weakness—difficulty lifting a grocery bag and brushing her hair—with preserved sensation and no numbness. She notes dyspnea on exertion with stairs but denies orthopnea. Symptoms briefly worsened after a recent upper respiratory infection. Past medical history is notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She has lost three pounds unintentionally. No fevers, rashes, or focal sensory deficits are reported. Symptoms are fluctuating and fatigable, prompting concern for a neuromuscular process."
P0958,"A 43-year-old man reports five days of progressive exertional shortness of breath and sharp, right-sided pleuritic chest pain that worsens with deep inspiration. He has a dry cough and experienced a small episode of hemoptysis yesterday. He describes intermittent palpitations and lightheadedness when climbing stairs. He noticed right calf swelling and aching beginning shortly after a prolonged 12-hour car trip two weeks ago. At home he measured resting oxygen saturation near 88% on a fingertip device. He has a history of well-controlled hypertension and denies fever or recent chest trauma. He is otherwise active but stopped biking this week because of dyspnea. Symptoms raised concern for a thromboembolic event given the unilateral leg swelling, recent immobilization, pleuritic pain, hypoxemia, and hemoptysis."
P0959,
P0960,"A 22-year-old female reports a 10-day history of progressive blurring in the right eye, accompanied by aching pain with eye movement and subjective loss of color saturation. Her primary care clinician noted a relative afferent pupillary defect on brief exam. She also describes intermittent diplopia and a fatigable right-sided eyelid droop that worsens toward evening. Symptoms began after a self-limited upper respiratory illness two weeks earlier. She endorses new transient paresthesias in her fingertips and mild unsteadiness when tired but denies fever, discharge, or head trauma. No prior ocular surgery; has occasional tension-type headaches. Concern raised for optic neuritis in the context of a possible postinfectious or demyelinating process; neuro-ophthalmology evaluation is being sought."
P0961,"A 20-year-old woman presents with a five-day progressive bifrontal headache, described as constant pressure with superimposed throbbing spikes, accompanied by photophobia, nausea, and two episodes of emesis. Over the past 36 hours she developed intermittent right-hand numbness and paresthesia and noted brief twitching of her right thumb consistent with a focal motor seizure. She started combined oral contraceptives six months ago and completed a course of antibiotics for presumed sinusitis two weeks prior. She also reports transient double vision and morning worsening of headache. No prior migraine history, no fevers currently, and no known thrombophilia, though a maternal uncle had an unprovoked deep vein thrombosis. She seeks evaluation for worsening neurologic deficits."
P0962,"A 26-year-old tall, thin male presents with sudden onset left-sided pleuritic chest pain and acute dyspnea that began while playing soccer two hours ago. Pain is sharp, worse with deep inspiration and coughing, and associated with a dry cough and lightheadedness but no fever. He reports a mild upper respiratory illness with nasal congestion and throat soreness over the past week and smokes intermittently. On exam he notes rapid heartbeat and subjective air hunger; he felt a brief pop sensation in the chest before symptoms intensified. He has no prior cardiopulmonary disease. Concern for primary spontaneous pneumothorax is raised given the sudden unilateral pleuritic pain, diminished breath sounds and hyperresonance on the affected side; pulmonary embolism and asthma exacerbation are secondary considerations."
P0963,"A 95-year-old female presents with sudden, painless loss of vision in the right eye for about 10 hours. She describes several transient episodes of monocular visual dimming over the past week, now progressed to near-complete vision loss, and reports new temporal headache, scalp tenderness when combing her hair, and intermittent jaw claudication while eating. She has had low-grade fever and malaise for several days but denies ocular pain, discharge, or recent trauma. Past medical history includes hypertension, known dry age-related macular degeneration, and bilateral cataracts under observation. Family notes marked difficulty with activities of daily living due to the acute loss. Findings are most concerning for arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy versus central retinal artery occlusion; urgent ophthalmology and vascular evaluation requested."
P0964,"A 67-year-old man presents with six months of gradually worsening central blurring in the right eye, now with acute worsening over the past week characterized by marked metamorphopsia and a persistent central dark spot. He denies ocular pain or significant photophobia but notes difficulty reading and distinguishing faces; peripheral vision feels unchanged. Past ocular history includes uncomplicated cataract extraction in the left eye two years ago. Known hypertension is treated conservatively. Prior retinal exam documented macular drusen; recent self-administered Amsler grid testing showed enlarging distortion. He reports no prior intravitreal therapy. Examination elsewhere suggested subretinal hemorrhage and suspected neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration of the right eye; he seeks urgent retinal evaluation for possible anti-VEGF treatment."
P0965,
P0966,"An 87-year-old man reports two weeks of progressively worse exertional dyspnea after a self-limited upper respiratory illness three weeks ago. He now awakens at night with breathlessness and orthopnea, and describes a chronic productive cough that has become more frequent with scant whitish sputum. Family notes reduced exercise tolerance and a one-week history of new bilateral ankle swelling. He denies chest pain or fever. On exertion he becomes visibly tachypneic and reports wheeze and increased work of breathing; baseline oxygen saturation has dropped into the low 90s. Known history includes COPD with remote smoking. Current presentation is most consistent with acute decompensation—likely COPD exacerbation with superimposed volume overload/heart failure—prompting evaluation for hypoxic respiratory failure and fluid management."
P0967,"A 24-year-old male presents with three weeks of progressive, fluctuating muscle weakness and double vision. He first noticed intermittent diplopia and unilateral ptosis that worsen by evening and after activity, then developed increasing proximal limb weakness affecting stairs and overhead tasks. Over the past week he reports mild dysphagia with occasional coughing when swallowing thin liquids and a nasal quality to his speech. He also endorses exertional dyspnea with short walks but denies sensory changes, numbness, or pain. Symptoms began after a self-limited upper respiratory infection two weeks prior. No prior neurologic history. Exam at home improved after rest. The pattern of fatigability, ocular involvement, dysphagia, and recent viral prodrome is concerning for a neuromuscular junction disorder such as myasthenia gravis."
P0968,"A 58-year-old man presents with three months of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough, with accelerated breathlessness over the past two weeks. He reports decreased exercise tolerance and a 6‑kg unintentional weight loss; denied fevers or hemoptysis. On exertion he notes lightheadedness and occasional resting breathlessness; his wife noticed finger clubbing. He has a 40–pack‑year smoking history and treated hypertension. Exam was notable for fine inspiratory crackles and mild bilateral lower‑extremity edema. Prior chest radiograph reportedly showed interstitial markings; clinicians are now concerned for a fibrotic interstitial lung disease with associated pulmonary hypertension contributing to hypoxemia. He has not started new medications and denies occupational exposures."
P0969,"A 51-year-old man reports two weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a chronic productive cough, with sudden onset of pleuritic right-sided chest pain and scant hemoptysis beginning yesterday after a prolonged flight. He describes years of purulent sputum consistent with chronic bronchitis and a 30-pack-year smoking history. Three days ago he noticed new right calf swelling and tightness. He has felt intermittently febrile but denies recent upper respiratory infection or known malignancy. Activity tolerance has fallen — he now tires after short walks. The temporal sequence of chronic airway symptoms, recent unilateral leg swelling, and acute pleuritic pain following long travel raises concern for pulmonary embolism superimposed on underlying chronic obstructive airway disease."
P0970,"A 67-year-old woman reports three weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea with new orthopnea and two episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. She describes increasing fatigue and a 5-pound weight gain over the past week with noticeable bilateral pitting ankle swelling. Ten days ago she began intermittent palpitations described as irregular, rapid beats and occasional lightheadedness. She also endorses a nocturnal, nonproductive cough but denies fever, sputum, or syncope. She has a long-standing history of hypertension and notes decreased exercise tolerance—now short of breath after walking one block. Symptoms have worsened despite resting at home. She is concerned about heart failure or an arrhythmia and seeks evaluation for possible decompensation."
P0971,"A 93-year-old female reports sudden, painless loss of vision in the left eye over the past 48 hours superimposed on chronic central blurring from known age-related macular degeneration. She describes new left-sided scalp tenderness and jaw claudication with chewing that began three days ago, and mild low-grade fevers and fatigue over the past week. She recalls worsening morning shoulder stiffness consistent with prior polymyalgia rheumatica. On exam at home she noted a firm prominence over the left temporal region and denies eye discharge or trauma. Past history significant for cataract surgery years ago and longstanding hypertension. Family is concerned about permanent vision loss; she is being evaluated urgently for possible giant cell arteritis and ischemic optic neuropathy."
P0972,"A 77-year-old man presents with six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent nonproductive cough that began after a brief upper respiratory illness. He now tires walking a single block and notes intermittent lightheadedness with exertion. He reports an 8-pound unintentional weight loss and intermittent low-grade fevers with night sweats but denies hemoptysis or chest pain. Examination at home noted new fingernail clubbing and his spouse comments he sounds “raspy” at the bases; auscultation revealed bibasilar fine inspiratory crackles on prior clinic exam. He is a former 30 pack-year smoker, stopped two decades ago, and uses no regular inhalers. There is no orthopnea or leg swelling. He is worried about a chronic lung process and reduced exercise tolerance."
P0973,
P0974,"A 19-year-old female presents with three days of progressive right-sided pleuritic chest pain and worsening shortness of breath that began after a viral upper respiratory illness. Pain is sharp, localized to the right hemithorax, worse with deep inspiration and coughing; she reports a nonproductive cough with one episode of scant blood-tinged sputum. She notes low-grade fevers and palpitations but denies trauma, leg swelling, or prior clotting disorders. At home she felt markedly short of breath and noted decreased breath sounds on the right with a sense of chest tightness. Past history significant only for intermittent childhood asthma; she occasionally smokes socially. Exam findings of unilateral hyperresonance are concerning for a primary spontaneous pneumothorax; urgent evaluation is planned."
P0975,
P0976,"A 28-year-old male presents with three weeks of progressive occipital headaches and new cognitive slowing. Symptoms began after a self-limited upper respiratory infection; headaches were initially intermittent but have become daily throbbing occipital pain with photophobia and transient scintillating visual auras. Over the past week he developed intermittent confusion, slowed speech, and subjective memory lapses. Two days ago a witnessed focal motor seizure characterized by repetitive right-hand twitching with brief dysarthria occurred; postictal confusion lasted several hours. He also reports intermittent low-grade fevers and neck stiffness without nuchal erythema. No prior neurologic history, no recent travel, and no substance use. Family notes decreased work performance and it prompted presentation today."
P0977,"A 73-year-old woman presents with three weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and decreased exercise tolerance. She reports new orthopnea requiring two pillows, leg swelling to the knees, and intermittent palpitations with a brief near-syncope while climbing stairs last week. She notes activity-limiting fatigue and occasional lightheadedness. Primary care recently documented hypertension and chronic kidney disease stage 3; she has no chest pain but family noticed an irregular pulse. Onset of symptoms followed a period of iron-deficiency anemia treated conservatively. Examination raised concern for congestive heart failure with a new harsh systolic ejection murmur consistent with aortic stenosis and an irregularly irregular rhythm suggesting paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Symptoms have worsened despite rest, prompting ED evaluation."

He reports increasing postprandial nausea with two to three episodes of nonbilious vomiting per week and an 8-kg unintentional weight loss. Over the past three weeks he has noticed intermittent black, tarry stools. Primary care noted new iron-deficiency anemia on routine testing. He has a remote history of peptic ulcer disease and admits to regular NSAID use for chronic low back pain; he recalls prior treatment for Helicobacter pylori but is unsure of eradication. No fevers or overt jaundice. Concern is for complicated peptic disease with possible gastric outlet obstruction or underlying malignancy; he requests endoscopic evaluation."
P0986,"A 72-year-old woman reports a week of intermittent right arm and leg numbness with brief episodes of slurred speech, evolving into persistent right-sided weakness and expressive aphasia since this morning. Symptoms began as transient focal deficits lasting 10–20 minutes, occurring three to four times over five days before progression. She reports intermittent lightheadedness and one presyncopal spell on standing. Past medical history significant for longstanding hypertension and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, with patient noting a recent symptomatic AF episode last week. On review she endorses neck bruit and intermittent monocular visual blurring before some events. No fever or headache. The pattern is concerning for crescendo TIAs from probable cardioembolic or carotid etiology with evolving infarction."
P0987,"A 34-year-old male presents with two days of sudden, sharp right-sided pleuritic chest pain and progressive exertional dyspnea. Pain began abruptly while climbing stairs and is worse with deep inspiration; he reports one small episode of blood-tinged sputum. He notes intermittent palpitations and near-syncope with activity. Five days earlier he completed a 10-hour flight and has had increasing left calf tightness and mild swelling since then. Past history notable for childhood asthma and a prior unprovoked deep venous thrombosis with heterozygous Factor V Leiden; he is not on chronic anticoagulation.

P0992,"A 34-year-old female reports a two-week history of increasingly frequent unilateral throbbing headaches, now occurring every 2–3 days and lasting 4–12 hours. Attacks typically begin with a scintillating visual aura and progressive photophobia and phonophobia, followed by severe nausea and vomiting. Over the past week she has had two episodes of transient right-sided paresthesia with mild weakness and brief slurred speech lasting 30–60 minutes. She also describes intermittent horizontal diplopia and new gait unsteadiness between headaches. Symptoms began after a mild upper respiratory infection and are worsened by exertion and poor sleep. She denies fever or neck stiffness. Past headaches were less frequent menstrual migraines; mother has migraine history. She sought evaluation because of the new focal neurologic features."
P0993,"A 65-year-old male reports three months of progressively worsening shortness of breath, initially with brisk stair climbing and now at minimal exertion. He has a chronic productive cough with yellow sputum, intermittent wheeze, and two episodes of scant hemoptysis over the past month following a viral bronchitis. He carries a 40–pack-year smoking history and known COPD with prior exacerbations. Over the last six weeks he notes decreased exercise tolerance with exertional desaturation requiring frequent rest, new mild bilateral lower extremity swelling, fatigue, and an unintended 8-pound weight loss. He denies fevers or overt chest pain but is concerned these changes represent advancing pulmonary hypertension or progression of his obstructive lung disease."
P0994,"A 39-year-old male presents with six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and fatigue that began three weeks after a febrile upper respiratory illness. He now wakes once or twice nightly breathless (paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea) and requires two pillows to sleep because of orthopnea. He reports 10-pound weight gain and new bilateral ankle swelling, decreased exercise tolerance, and intermittent palpitations with a near-syncope episode after climbing stairs. He describes occasional exertional chest tightness but no sharp pleuritic pain. He has a history of well-controlled hypertension diagnosed two years ago. There is no tobacco use. The temporal clustering and preceding viral prodrome raise concern for new cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure rather than primary pulmonary disease."

P0996,"An 80-year-old woman presents with a three-month history of progressive gait instability and two unwitnessed falls at home. Family reports gradual slowing of thought, impaired short-term memory, and increasing difficulty with multitasking over the same interval. She has developed urinary urgency with one episode of daytime incontinence and now needs assistance rising from a chair. On exam she demonstrates a broad-based, magnetic gait with reduced step height and hesitancy to initiate walking but no marked focal weakness. A noncontrast head CT last month reportedly showed ventriculomegaly. She has a history of hypertension. There is no fever, dysphagia, or new visual loss. Concern is for possible normal-pressure hydrocephalus versus a parkinsonian neurodegenerative process contributing to functional decline."
P0997,"A 25-year-old woman presents with a five-day history of progressive, severe holocephalic headache now maximal and constant for 24 hours, accompanied by nausea and two episodes of vomiting. She reports new intermittent photophobia and transient blurring of vision, and yesterday had two self-limited episodes of left arm numbness and weakness lasting several minutes. A roommate witnessed a brief generalized shaking spell last night. She started combined oral contraceptives three months ago and had a recent treated sinus infection two weeks prior. In the ED she complained of worsening morning headache and ophthalmology noted mild bilateral optic disc swelling. She denies prior migraine history, fever, or recent head trauma. Symptoms prompted urgent neuroimaging for concern about a thrombotic process."
P0998,"A 26-year-old man reports three months of progressive exertional dyspnea and reduced exercise tolerance, now limiting his ability to play competitive soccer. Over the past two weeks he has experienced intermittent palpitations and two brief presyncopal episodes during intense exertion, described as lightheadedness with transient tunnel vision. He also notes exertional chest tightness without radiation and occasional nocturnal dyspnea that awakens him once or twice per week. Symptoms began insidiously after a viral illness but have steadily worsened despite rest. He denies chest pain at rest, illicit drug use, or recent travel; drinks several energy drinks before games. Family history is notable for an uncle who died suddenly at age 42. No prior cardiac diagnosis or regular medications."
P0999,"A 21-year-old female reports a 6-day history of progressive blurring and central vision loss in her right eye, accompanied by aching pain worsened by eye movement.

P1001,"An 87-year-old female reports one week of progressive exertional dyspnea now occurring with minimal ambulation and associated orthopnea requiring two pillows. She describes two nocturnal episodes of sudden breathlessness that awaken her and new bilateral ankle swelling. She has intermittent palpitations and mild lightheadedness; family noted an irregular, occasionally rapid pulse at home. Past history includes hypertension and known atrial fibrillation with prior diastolic dysfunction consistent with HFpEF. She denies chest pain or syncope but notes markedly reduced exercise tolerance compared with baseline independence. Symptoms began after a period of decreased mobility and increased dietary sodium. No fever, but she endorses a small-volume productive cough without hemoptysis."
P0102,"A 15-year-old female reports a three-week history of progressive shortness of breath with exertion and intermittent dry cough that began after a viral upper respiratory infection. Symptoms are most pronounced during running and choir practice, when she develops throat tightness and a high-pitched inspiratory noise rather than classic expiratory wheeze. She notes decreased exercise tolerance and occasional nighttime coughing that wakes her. Past history is notable for atopic dermatitis and perennial nasal congestion with sporadic sneezing. Cold air and anxiety reliably provoke episodes, during which she describes rapid shallow breathing. She denies fevers, chest pain, or hemoptysis; symptoms have been only minimally responsive to rest and throat lozenges."
P0103,
P0104,"A 67-year-old woman presents with three months of progressive gait instability characterized by short, shuffling steps and several near-falls. Her daughter reports difficulty initiating walking and a more pronounced magnetic quality to her stride; falls have increased over the past four weeks. She has developed urinary urgency with two brief episodes of incontinence and noticeable slowing of memory and multitasking. She also endorses intermittent dull headaches and mild bilateral lower-extremity numbness and tingling, worse at night. Symptoms began insidiously without antecedent illness. Past medical history notable for hypertension and type 2 diabetes; she attributes the leg paresthesias to diabetes. No visual changes, dysphagia, or focal weakness reported. She is seeking evaluation for progressive balance and cognitive decline."
P0105,"A 62-year-old woman presents with progressive exertional dyspnea over two weeks, worse with climbing stairs and accompanied by a new productive cough producing yellow-green sputum with occasional blood streaks. She reports pleuritic right-sided chest discomfort that increases with deep inspiration and intermittent wheeze noticed at night. Low-grade fevers and night sweats began five days ago after a recent upper respiratory illness. She has a remote 20 pack-year smoking history, known COPD and hypertension, and baseline limited mobility from osteoarthritis. No recent travel or known sick contacts. She denies chest pressure consistent with angina but notes mild bilateral ankle swelling over several days. Symptoms have limited her ability to perform usual activities."
P0106,"A 42-year-old man presents with five days of progressive exertional dyspnea and new left-sided pleuritic chest pain. Symptoms began within a week after a long-haul flight; he developed left calf swelling and tenderness three days ago and today noted blood-tinged sputum. He reports intermittent palpitations and feels lightheaded with minimal exertion; at home he noted oxygen saturation in the high 80s on room air. He has a history of treated hypertension but no prior thrombotic events. The sequence of recent prolonged travel, unilateral leg swelling, acute pleuritic pain, hemoptysis, hypoxemia and tachycardia is concerning for deep venous thrombosis with pulmonary embolism, potentially causing pulmonary infarction, and warrants urgent evaluation."
P0107,"A 71-year-old female reports two weeks of progressive central vision distortion in the left eye, with worsening metamorphopsia and a new central scotoma that limits reading. She also notes an increase in floaters without erythema or purulent discharge and denies severe ocular pain. Three days ago she developed a persistent left-sided temporal headache and intermittent jaw claudication when chewing, which she finds concerning in the setting of her visual change. Past medical history is significant for long-standing hypertension and hyperlipidemia and prior cataract extraction in the right eye. She denies recent trauma, diplopia, systemic fever, or weight loss and seeks urgent evaluation for possible ischemic or neovascular causes of her vision loss."
P0108,"A 49-year-old man presents with six weeks of intermittent diplopia and bilateral ptosis, progressively worse toward evening and after exertion. He describes fluctuating proximal limb weakness — difficulty rising from a chair and combing hair — and new intermittent dysphagia for solids and liquids over the past two weeks. Shortness of breath with minimal exertion and nocturnal breathlessness raise concern for bulbar and respiratory muscle involvement. Symptoms began shortly after an upper respiratory infection. Past history notable only for well-controlled hypertension. He denies sensory loss, fever, or recent trauma. Examination at home is notable for variable eyelid droop and fatigable weakness. Concern is for myasthenia gravis with possible thymoma; urgent neuromuscular evaluation and chest imaging are requested."
P0109,"A 53-year-old woman presents with six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea that began after a prolonged upper respiratory illness and is now limiting climbing a single flight of stairs. She has a persistent dry cough and intermittent pleuritic right-sided chest discomfort, with one episode of scant hemoptysis. She reports new exertional palpitations and lightheadedness and has noticed mild ankle swelling toward the end of the day. She is a former 30-pack-year smoker who quit a decade ago and has a history of hypertension. No recent long travel or immobilization. Symptoms raise concern for thromboembolic disease versus evolving interstitial lung process with possible secondary pulmonary hypertension; she denies fever but feels fatigued and has lost a few pounds unintentionally."
P0110,A 53-year-old woman presents with a six-week history of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough. Symptoms began as mild shortness of breath on stairs and now limit walking one block; she endorses new orthopnea and two near-syncope episodes with minimal exertion. Intermittent pleuritic right-sided chest discomfort has been present for ten days. One week after a prolonged transcontinental flight she developed unilateral calf swelling and aching. She has a history of treated hypertension and a remote 15-pack-year smoking history but no known COPD or asthma. She denies fevers or sputum production. The temporal pattern and calf swelling raise concern for pulmonary embolism with possible evolving pulmonary hypertension and right-sided strain.

P0112,"An 84-year-old man reports a six-week history of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough that began after a bronchitic illness three weeks ago. He now becomes short of breath with minimal activity, is limited to the house, and wakes at night with breathlessness and intermittent orthopnea. Family notes new bilateral ankle swelling over the past ten days. He denies chest pain, fevers, or sputum production. On prior visits he carries diagnoses of COPD and hypertension. He describes slowed appetite and mild weight loss. Recent exertion causes noticeable desaturation and he has developed digital clubbing; auscultation at baseline reportedly reveals fine inspiratory crackles at the bases. He is worried symptoms are steadily worsening and interfering with daily care."
P0113,"A 4-year-old female presents with three days of purulent right ear drainage and progressive otalgia after a week-long runny nose. Parents report tugging at the ear, increasing irritability, and a febrile episode to 38.9°C last night. They noticed markedly decreased hearing on the right and a small episode of imbalance with one brief fall today. Drainage began suddenly after presumed bulging of the eardrum and is described as yellow-green; she has had reduced oral intake but no vomiting. On inspection at home there is mild postauricular swelling and tenderness behind the right ear, raising concern for acute otitis media with tympanic membrane perforation and early mastoiditis. No neck stiffness, seizure, or skin rash reported; immunizations up to date and no prior ear surgeries."
P0114,"A 65-year-old woman presents with four weeks of progressive gait instability and intermittent vertigo. Symptoms began after a brief upper respiratory illness and were initially episodic but have become persistent, with two recent near-falls and increasing difficulty rising from chairs. Family reports new slurred speech over the past week and she describes horizontal oscillopsia with blurred vision on head movement. She also notes a new, constant left-sided tinnitus and subjective hearing decline. She denies focal limb numbness or new weakness. Her past medical history is notable for well-controlled hypertension. She remains independent at baseline but is limiting activities because of frequent unsteadiness and fear of falling."

P0118,"An 82-year-old woman presents with sudden, painless loss of vision in her left eye that began overnight after two weeks of progressive symptoms. She describes several transient episodes of partial visual obscuration in that eye over the past week, now evolving to near-complete loss. Concurrently she has developed a new, constant right-sided temporal headache, scalp tenderness when combing her hair, and jaw claudication with chewing. She reports proximal shoulder and hip stiffness most pronounced in the mornings, low-grade fevers, and fatigue, but denies trauma, diplopia, or recent illness. No prior ophthalmologic procedures. The temporal pattern and constellation of scalp tenderness, jaw pain, new headache, proximal stiffness, and acute monocular vision loss are concerning for an ischemic arteritis process."
P0119,
P0120,"A 49-year-old female reports two months of progressive right-sided proptosis with intermittent binocular diplopia, most notable on lateral gaze. She describes blurred central vision and intermittent transient obscurations, and a dull retro-orbital ache that worsens with eye movement. Examination findings at urgent clinic included upper eyelid retraction and periorbital fullness; patient also notes a fine tremor. Over the preceding six weeks she developed palpitations, heat intolerance, and unintended weight loss, suggesting new thyrotoxic symptoms. She has a remote history of well-controlled hypertension. She denies recent trauma, infection, or visual loss sudden enough to suggest vascular occlusion. The temporal sequence and combination of proptosis, eyelid signs, diplopia, and systemic hyperadrenergic features raise concern for thyroid-associated orbitopathy."

P0122,"A 9-year-old girl presents with six weeks of intermittent crampy periumbilical abdominal pain that has become daily and more severe over the past two weeks. Initially associated with transient watery stools, she now has frequent bloody, watery diarrhea and occasional nonbilious vomiting. Parents report reduced appetite, a 3–4 lb weight loss, and increasing fatigue; she has missed several days of school. Low-grade fevers occur most evenings. On review, she has had two small painful oral aphthous ulcers and recent perianal pain with minor fissuring. She had no recent travel or antibiotic exposure and no known sick contacts. Symptoms are unresponsive to dietary changes at home, raising concern for an inflammatory enteropathy such as pediatric inflammatory bowel disease versus a protracted infectious colitis."
P0123,"A 77-year-old female reports acute, progressive vision loss in the left eye over three days following two weeks of new temporal headaches. She describes central blurring with intermittent floaters but no discharge or photophobia. Associated symptoms include scalp tenderness over the left temple, jaw claudication when chewing, and morning stiffness in the shoulders and hips lasting 30–45 minutes. She notes low-grade fevers and decreased appetite but denies recent trauma or prior retinal disease. Primary care documented an elevated inflammatory marker earlier this week. Past medical history is notable only for longstanding hypertension. Patient is worried about sudden permanent vision change; symptoms are most consistent with ischemic optic neuropathy in the setting of suspected giant cell arteritis."
P0124,"An 11-year-old boy presents with three weeks of progressive exertional shortness of breath and a persistent high-pitched cough that began after a presumed viral upper respiratory infection. Symptoms are most pronounced during soccer, with noisy inspiratory breathing and intermittent throat tightness; parents note hoarseness and frequent throat clearing. He also reports sporadic wheeze and chest tightness with activity but denies fever, purulent sputum, or weight loss. Symptoms wake him once or twice weekly and have reduced his exercise tolerance; rest and an over-the-counter cough suppressant provided no benefit. There is no prior history of asthma or allergic rhinitis. Recent school pulse oximetry was normal. Concern centers on a laryngeal process with possible reactive airways component such as exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction."
P0125,"A 94-year-old man presents with six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough that began after a brief upper respiratory illness. He describes increasing orthopnea and two episodes of nocturnal breathlessness waking him from sleep, and reports reduced appetite with a three-kilogram weight loss. On exertion he notes lightheadedness and more frequent palpitations; family observed an irregular pulse. He has intermittent low-grade fevers and persistent bibasilar crackles at rest, with new bilateral pitting edema. Caregivers recall a remote smoking history and longstanding mild dysphagia with occasional choking. The constellation raises concern for chronic interstitial lung disease with superimposed aspiration and decompensated congestive heart failure, possibly precipitated by atrial fibrillation. He denies chest pain or hemoptysis."
P0126,"A 94-year-old man reports three weeks of progressively worse exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough, worsened after a presumed upper respiratory infection about ten days ago. He has a long-standing diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and hypertension. Over the past week he notes increased breathlessness at rest with intermittent low-grade fevers, reduced appetite, and a two-kilogram weight loss. At home he is now requiring supplemental oxygen for desaturation with minimal exertion. On exam he has new bibasilar inspiratory crackles without focal consolidation by history and no leg swelling. He denies chest pain or syncope. Clinical concern is for acute exacerbation of his fibrotic lung disease versus a superimposed infection contributing to hypoxemia."
P0127,"A 0-year-old male infant is brought for progressive respiratory distress over three days, beginning with clear rhinorrhea and low-grade fever and evolving to frequent cough and audible wheeze. Parents describe increasing work of breathing with nasal flaring, intercostal retractions and persistent tachypnea; oral feeds have decreased markedly and urine output is reduced. Caregivers noted two brief oxygen desaturations while asleep. There was a recent household upper respiratory illness preceding symptoms. Birth history significant for late prematurity. On exam in clinic he had diffuse wheeze and coarse breath sounds. Working impression is viral bronchiolitis with hypoxemia and dehydration risk; differential includes early bacterial superinfection or evolving lobar pneumonia."
P0128,
P0129,"A 33-year-old female presents with a six-day history of progressively blurred vision in the left eye, now described as a central gray patch with reduced acuity and color desaturation. She notes sharp retro-orbital pain that worsens with eye movement and intermittent photophobia; floaters have been present since onset. Symptoms began two weeks after a self-limited upper respiratory infection and are accompanied by low-grade headaches but no fever or discharge. She denies trauma, diplopia at rest, or prior ocular disease. On review she reports increased fatigue and one transient episode of numbness in the left hand last month. Exam by primary clinician suggested a relative afferent pupillary defect in the left eye; referral for neuro-ophthalmology and urgent imaging was arranged."
P0130,"A 13-year-old boy presents with two weeks of progressively worse morning headache and intermittent throbbing occipital pain. Headaches are worse on waking and with bending forward, and over the last five days he has had two episodes of vomiting and several brief visual obscurations described as transient gray-outs. He also reports intermittent horizontal diplopia and a new whooshing sound in his right ear when lying flat. Mother notes recent weight gain this year. He had a mild nasal congestion episode consistent with sinusitis three weeks ago and bumped his head on a gym mat about ten days ago without loss of consciousness. On examination he endorses neck stiffness and is concerned about blurring; concern raised for raised intracranial pressure such as idiopathic intracranial hypertension or postinfectious process."
P0131,"A 34-year-old man presents with five days of progressive pleuritic right-sided chest pain and exertional dyspnea. Pain is sharp, worse with deep inspiration and coughing, and began after a 10-hour flight two weeks ago; he notes a prior week of nasal congestion and sore throat that resolved. Over the past 48 hours he developed a dry cough with one small episode of blood-tinged sputum and intermittent palpitations with lightheadedness. He also reports progressive swelling and tenderness of the right calf since returning from travel. He has a history of intermittent exercise-induced asthma but uses no daily inhaler. He denies recent trauma, known bleeding disorder, or anticoagulant use. Symptoms are limiting work and prompt evaluation for suspected deep vein thrombosis with secondary pulmonary embolism."
P0132,"A 6-year-old male with history of atopic dermatitis presents with four days of progressive cough and audible wheeze. Symptoms began with nasal congestion and low-grade fever after a classmate developed bronchiolitis; parents report a household contact with similar illness. Over three days cough worsened and he developed increased work of breathing with intermittent intercostal and subcostal retractions, nocturnal cough disturbing sleep, and decreased oral intake. There is occasional nonbilious emesis after coughing but no hemoptysis. On exam at urgent care he was noted to be tachypneic with inspiratory and expiratory wheeze. Parents deny known asthma diagnosis. Concern is for viral bronchiolitis or viral-induced reactive airways disease with early dehydration; bacterial pneumonia is considered less likely."

P0139,"A 52-year-old woman reports ten days of progressive exertional dyspnea with a sudden onset of sharp, right-sided pleuritic chest pain two days ago. She has a persistent nonproductive cough and intermittent palpitations; she felt tachycardic at rest last night and notes low-grade fevers. Symptoms began after a 12-hour flight two weeks ago. She also describes new swelling and aching of the left calf for five days. Past medical history is notable for well-controlled hypertension and adult-onset asthma, and she is a former smoker. She denies hemoptysis but feels more breathless than with prior bronchospasm. Given the temporal pattern, unilateral leg swelling, and acute pleuritic pain with tachycardia, she is concerned about possible deep venous thrombosis with pulmonary embolism."
P0140,"A 77-year-old woman presents with three months of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough, worsened over the past two weeks after a presumed viral upper respiratory infection. She denies fever or productive sputum but reports decreased exercise tolerance and mild activity-related lightheadedness. She is a former 30-pack-year smoker with a history of well-controlled hypertension. Examiner noted bibasilar inspiratory crackles and mild digital clubbing; resting oxygen saturation was 91% on room air with desaturation on minimal exertion. Outpatient chest radiograph reportedly showed basilar interstitial markings. Referring clinician is concerned for interstitial lung disease, most consistent with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and has arranged expedited pulmonary function testing and high-resolution chest CT."

P0143,"A 1-year-old male presents with two days of progressively worse, intermittent severe abdominal pain characterized by sudden screaming episodes during which he draws his knees up, followed by periods of apparent comfort. Parents report four episodes of nonbilious vomiting and one passage of red, mucus‑streaked stool this morning. Oral intake has declined markedly and wet diapers are fewer over 24 hours; caregivers describe increased lethargy and a low‑grade fever after a recent upper respiratory infection last week. On examination at home they felt a firm, sausage‑shaped mass in the right mid‑abdomen. No prior surgeries. The pattern of colicky pain, vomiting, bloody stool, and a palpable abdominal mass raises concern for intussusception with dehydration and systemic effects."
P0144,"A 22-year-old female reports a two-month history of progressive epigastric burning pain and early postprandial fullness, worse after larger meals and frequently awakening her at night. Pain is partially relieved by over-the-counter antacids but now accompanied by nausea and intermittent non-bilious vomiting. Over the past three weeks she notes an 8-pound unintentional weight loss and two episodes of dark, tarry stools. She began regular NSAID use for dysmenorrhea about three months ago. She also complains of new fatigue with exertion. No prior peptic ulcer disease or liver disease. Social history is negative for tobacco or heavy alcohol.

P0148,"A 41-year-old man presents with three weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and pleuritic right-sided chest pain that began after a long transcontinental flight. He reports episodic scant hemoptysis and a dry cough, worse with exertion, and notes new right calf swelling and mild palpitations intermittently. He describes decreased exercise tolerance, brief wheeze relieved with his occasional albuterol inhaler, and a remote 10 pack-year smoking history, quit five years ago. He denies fevers or night sweats and has no recent upper respiratory symptoms. Past history is notable only for childhood asthma. Symptoms have steadily worsened rather than fluctuating, and he is concerned about a blood clot given the leg swelling and shortness of breath."
P0149,"A 23-year-old female reports six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and intermittent wheeze following a brief upper respiratory illness. She describes a dry cough that worsens at night and with exercise, and intermittent chest tightness with uphill walking; symptoms are triggered by cold air and spicy meals. She uses an albuterol inhaler PRN with partial relief. She has seasonal allergic rhinitis and frequent heartburn consistent with reflux. She denies fevers, weight loss, tobacco use, or hemoptysis. She recalls a spontaneous pneumothorax several months ago that required observation but no surgery. Symptoms have limited her running tolerance and led to missed workouts and one clinic visit for recurrent bronchitic episodes in childhood. She is concerned about exercise-induced bronchospasm versus vocal cord dysfunction."
P0150,"A 77-year-old female reports ten days of progressive exertional dyspnea with intermittent pleuritic right-sided chest discomfort. She notes new orthopnea and a nocturnal cough producing scant sputum, and has felt two brief episodes of palpitations. Family noticed increased swelling of her ankles and mild asymmetry of the right calf. Symptoms began after a mild upper respiratory illness three weeks ago and have steadily limited her ambulation. Past medical history is notable for hypertension and atrial fibrillation, and she had a remote proximal deep vein thrombosis six months prior. No fevers or syncope. Examination and testing are pending, but she is concerned about possible pulmonary embolism versus cardiac decompensation as explanations for the subacute dyspnea."
P0151,"A 17-year-old female reports a six-week history of progressive palpitations and episodic diaphoresis with an unintentional 12-pound weight loss. She endorses persistent heat intolerance, a coarse resting hand tremor, and increasing nervousness that interferes with concentration at school.

On exam she notes palpitations and subjective tachycardia; she has a history of mild intermittent asthma without recent inhaler use. Symptoms progressed over hours and she felt an abrupt improvement in cough but worsening dyspnea. She reports no trauma, tobacco use, or recent travel. Concern is for primary spontaneous pneumothorax versus asthma exacerbation; she is anxious and prefers evaluation for cause."
P0158,"A 62-year-old man presents with a six-month history of progressive exertional dyspnea and a daily productive cough that has acutely worsened over the past two weeks. He reports new scant hemoptysis and intermittent pleuritic right-sided chest pain, along with a five-kilogram unintentional weight loss and decreased exercise tolerance. He is a 40 pack-year former smoker with recurrent bronchitis in prior winters. On exam he appears mildly tachypneic with resting desaturation on exertion and focal coarse breath sounds with mild digital clubbing. He denies fevers or night sweats. Concern is for an underlying structural process—eg, COPD with possible right upper lobe neoplasm or postinfectious consolidation—so cross-sectional chest imaging and sputum studies have been requested for further evaluation."
P0159,"A 43-year-old woman reports eight weeks of progressive postprandial epigastric pain that intermittently radiates to the mid back and wakes her at night. Pain is dull with sharp flares after fatty meals and is accompanied by nausea and one to two greasy, foul-smelling stools daily. She notes an unintentional 9-pound weight loss and episodic dark urine with pale stools and generalized itching over the last month. She recalls a hospital visit for biliary colic two years ago but never had definitive treatment. She drinks alcohol socially and denies fevers or overt vomiting. Over-the-counter antacids provide minimal relief. She is concerned about persistent jaundice and malabsorption; differential considerations include choledocholithiasis with biliary obstruction, chronic pancreatitis, or a ductal stricture."
P0160,"A 99-year-old man presents with progressive gait instability and recurrent falls, worsening over the past six weeks after a gradual decline for several months. He reports shuffling and difficulty initiating steps, with two ground-level falls in the last two weeks and no loss of consciousness. Family describes increasing short-term memory problems and slowed processing over the same interval. He has developed urinary urgency with occasional incontinence that is new. Prior records note a broad-based, “magnetic” gait on physical therapy assessment and a remote ischemic stroke several years ago; he also has chronic hypertension under outpatient management. No fevers, focal sensory changes, or new focal weakness are reported. The constellation raises concern for normal-pressure hydrocephalus versus progression of cerebrovascular leukoencephalopathy."
P0161,"A 10-year-old boy presents with a six-week history of persistent cough and progressive exertional dyspnea that began after a febrile viral upper respiratory infection. Parents describe audible wheeze and intermittent chest tightness with activity, plus two to three episodes per week of nocturnal coughing that wakes him. He now tires quickly and cannot finish soccer practice due to breathlessness and exercise intolerance. There has been occasional sputum production but no ongoing fever. On a few occasions parents noted a brief inspiratory high-pitched noise at the throat. He has a history of atopic dermatitis and prior seasonal sneezing. A trial of an inhaled bronchodilator given at home produced modest, short-lived improvement. Primary concerns are postinfectious reactive airways disease or exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction."
P0162,
P0163,"A 53-year-old woman reports progressive exertional dyspnea for the past eight weeks, beginning after a protracted “bronchitis”-like illness and now limiting her daily walking. She has a persistent productive cough with intermittent streaks of blood, pleuritic right-sided chest discomfort, and increasing fatigue. She notes night sweats and an unintended five-kilogram weight loss over two months. Past medical history is notable only for well-controlled hypertension; she is a 30-pack-year former smoker. On review she describes decreased exercise tolerance and occasional wheeze; at home she feels more breathless lying flat. She denies fever currently but notes persistent coarse inspiratory crackles and subtle clubbing of the fingertips. She is concerned about an underlying chronic infection or malignancy and seeks evaluation."
P0164,"A 0-year-old male presents for progressive noisy breathing and poor feeding over the past three weeks. Parents report inspiratory stridor noted since birth that has become louder and more work-dependent, worse when supine or during feeds, and accompanied by choking with occasional brief apneic pauses and perioral cyanosis. He has had poor weight gain and frequent regurgitation. At home he develops tachypnea and subcostal retractions with crying; caregivers palpate frequent wet-sounding breaths. No fever or significant cough. Clinically the picture suggests upper airway obstruction—laryngomalacia versus vocal cord dysfunction—with concern that concomitant gastroesophageal reflux and intermittent aspiration are contributing to feeding intolerance and failure to thrive. No known congenital cardiac diagnosis, though cardiopulmonary evaluation is requested."
P0165,"A 42-year-old male reports six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a daily productive cough that began after a severe upper respiratory infection two months ago. Sputum is copious, purulent, occasionally blood‑streaked and foul‑smelling, with nocturnal cough that disrupts sleep. He describes intermittent wheeze and basal crackling that worsens with exertion, and low‑grade fevers and mild unintentional weight loss over the same interval. Past history notable for childhood asthma and lifelong recurrent sinusitis; he is a former 10–pack‑year smoker who quit five years ago. He denies recent travel or occupational exposures. He is concerned about bronchiectasis or postinfectious bronchiolitis given the volume of sputum and recurrent sinonasal symptoms and seeks evaluation for imaging and airway clearance."
P0166,
P0167,"A 76-year-old woman presents with three months of progressive gait difficulty characterized by a slow, magnetic, broad-based gait and several near-falls. Her daughter notes increasing short-term memory impairment, apathy, and difficulty initiating steps over the same interval. Family also reports new urinary urgency with occasional incontinence and nocturia. Symptoms began insidiously and were not associated with focal weakness, syncope, or new headache, though she endorses intermittent frontal pressure. Treated for a urinary tract infection two weeks ago with transient fever but persistent cognitive slowing and imbalance. Past mobility was limited by knee osteoarthritis, but current decline is out of proportion to joint pain. Examination and history raise concern for normal pressure hydrocephalus versus neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndrome; neurology evaluation and brain imaging are planned."
P0168,"A 79-year-old woman reports sudden, painless loss of vision in her right eye over the past 24 hours, describing a dense central scotoma and intermittent floaters. This event was preceded by two weeks of progressive right-sided temporal headache, scalp tenderness when combing her hair, and jaw claudication with chewing. She also notes new morning stiffness and aching in both shoulders and hips for several weeks, accompanied by low-grade fevers and fatigue. She denies eye trauma, discharge, or neurologic weakness, and has no recent infections. Past medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Symptoms are most consistent with a vasculitic process affecting the optic circulation, and she is concerned about permanent visual loss."
P0169,"A 76-year-old man reports six months of progressive gait instability with increasing frequency of falls and difficulty initiating steps, described by family as a ""shuffling, magnetic"" pattern. Over the same interval he has developed cognitive slowing, short-term memory lapses, and occasional word-finding difficulty, with new urinary urgency and two episodes of daytime incontinence in the past three months. Symptoms acutely worsened after a treated urinary tract infection two months ago. Past history is notable for hypertension and remote lumbar spondylosis. A non-contrast head CT three months earlier reportedly showed ventriculomegaly greater than expected for cortical atrophy. On review he endorses intermittent orthostatic dizziness and mild slowness of movement but denies focal weakness, sensory loss, or resting tremor."
P0170,
P0171,"A 5-year-old boy presents with four days of progressive cough and noisy breathing that began after rhinorrhea and mild sore throat. Parents describe frequent daytime coughing spells and nighttime paroxysms with audible expiratory wheeze and increased work of breathing, now with occasional intercostal retractions. He has a low‑grade fever and has taken in less fluids, with reduced activity and poor sleep. On day three he developed right ear pain and tugging, concerning for acute otitis media. He has a prior history of intermittent reactive airway disease related to viral infections but no prior intubations. Symptoms have not improved with supportive care at home, and clinic exam showed tachypnea with scattered wheezes, concerning for a viral‑induced asthma exacerbation complicating an upper respiratory infection."
P0172,"A 46-year-old woman reports sudden onset right-sided pleuritic chest pain and progressive dyspnea beginning two days after an eight-hour flight. Pain is sharp with deep inspiration and is accompanied by lightheadedness and intermittent palpitations; she noted a scant blood-tinged cough this morning. She also describes new swelling and tenderness of the right calf for the past 48 hours. Medical history is notable for obesity and perimenopausal estrogen replacement therapy; she is a former smoker. She denies recent trauma, prior thrombotic events, or active infection. Symptoms have worsened with minimal exertion and she feels more short of breath at rest. She is concerned because family members have had clotting disorders."
P0173,"A 56-year-old man presents with six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a chronic productive cough that has acutely worsened. He reports occasional blood-tinged sputum and pleuritic right-sided chest pain, worse with deep inspiration. Over the past month he has noticed a 12-pound unintentional weight loss and decreased exercise tolerance; he also describes new swelling and aching in the right calf. He has a 30-pack-year smoking history and a remote diagnosis of COPD with baseline exertional limitation. He is treated for hypertension. There was a recent upper respiratory illness two months ago that preceded the cough. Concern is for pulmonary embolism or an underlying malignancy exacerbating COPD."
P0174,"A 31-year-old man presents with abrupt onset left-sided pleuritic chest pain and progressive shortness of breath that began 48 hours ago. The pain is sharp, localized to the lateral chest, worse with deep inspiration and coughing, and increases with exertion. He describes intermittent palpitations and one episode of lightheadedness without syncope. He noted scant streaks of blood in sputum once yesterday. Five days before symptom onset he experienced aching and mild swelling of the right calf after a 10-hour bus trip. He is a current smoker with occasional wheeze during exertion and reports a low-grade fever and decreased exercise tolerance since symptoms started. No recent upper respiratory infection or known bleeding disorder. He is concerned the calf pain and new respiratory symptoms may be related."
P0175,"A 59-year-old man presents with three months of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough, noticeably worse over the past two weeks after a mild ""chest cold."" He reports intermittent pleuritic left-sided chest discomfort, low-grade fevers, and a 10-pound unintentional weight loss. Activity tolerance has fallen from walking two blocks to stopping after a single flight of stairs. He is a former 20-pack-year smoker and worked in shipyard construction with prolonged asbestos exposure three decades ago. On review he notes early morning shallow breathing but no swollen legs. Examination revealed finger clubbing and bibasilar inspiratory crackles. Past medical history notable only for hypertension. He denies hemoptysis, wheeze, or significant reflux."
P0176,"A 91-year-old woman reports progressive exertional dyspnea over the past six months, with notable worsening over the last two weeks accompanied by new orthopnea and increased lower-extremity swelling. She describes a persistent dry, nonproductive cough and a small unintentional weight loss over several months. Home oxygen saturations fall with minimal exertion. She has no fever, sputum, or chest pain. Prior records document bibasilar inspiratory crackles and mild digital clubbing on exam. She recalls a remote tobacco history and longstanding hypertension. Family noted decreasing activity tolerance and occasional nocturnal breathlessness. The temporal pattern suggests chronic interstitial lung disease with chronic hypoxemia and possible secondary pulmonary hypertension contributing to peripheral edema and worsening dyspnea."
P0177,"A 57-year-old female presents with six weeks of progressive central vision loss in the right eye, initially noticed as intermittent metamorphopsia and a small dark central scotoma when reading. Over two weeks the distortion worsened and she now reports difficulty focusing on print, intermittent photopsias and a sense that straight lines appear wavy. She has a remote diagnosis of dry age-related macular degeneration with known macular drusen, and describes this change as qualitatively different and more abrupt, raising concern for neovascular conversion. She denies ocular pain, diplopia, or systemic neurologic symptoms. She wears bifocals and has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both treated. No recent head trauma or flashes in the left eye."
P0178,"A 60-year-old woman presents with two weeks of progressive shortness of breath initially with exertion now occurring at rest, preceded by a brief upper respiratory infection. She describes orthopnea requiring two pillows and nightly awakening with breathlessness consistent with paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. She reports new bilateral ankle swelling and a three‑kilogram weight gain over ten days, reduced exercise tolerance, and intermittent palpitations with sudden racing episodes. She notes a dull exertional chest tightness but denies syncope. Past history includes long-standing hypertension and remote smoking. On review she mentions increased fatigue and clear sputum production without fever. Symptoms are most suggestive of volume overload from cardiac decompensation, possibly precipitated by arrhythmia. Further evaluation for heart failure and rhythm disturbance is requested."
P0179,"A 79-year-old female presents with acute, painless loss of vision in the right eye that began this morning after two weeks of new temporal headaches and scalp tenderness. She describes jaw claudication with chewing and progressive proximal shoulder and hip stiffness in the mornings consistent with polymyalgia rheumatica. She reports low-grade fevers, night sweats, and unintentional three-pound weight loss over the past month. On exam she notes a dense right central visual field defect and a new relative afferent pupillary defect; the right optic disc appears pale and swollen per outpatient ophthalmoscopy. She has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia but no prior cerebrovascular events. Symptoms are most consistent with giant cell arteritis causing arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy."
P0180,
P0181,"A 25-year-old man reports five days of progressive blurred vision in the left eye with aching retro-orbital pain that worsens on eye movement. He describes colors as ""washed out"" and noticed intermittent photopsias and a small central scotoma this morning. Symptoms began about two weeks after a brief viral upper respiratory illness; he denies trauma or discharge. He also experienced a transient tingling sensation in the right hand two days ago that resolved spontaneously. Past ocular history notable only for high myopia. He denies fever, neck stiffness, or recent travel. No chronic medical problems, no regular medications, and no illicit drug use. He is concerned the vision loss is getting steadily worse and wants urgent evaluation."
P0182,"A 75-year-old man reports six months of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent nonproductive cough, now limiting his ability to walk across the house. Symptoms began insidiously and have steadily worsened; he has lost about eight pounds and notes increased breathlessness after a recent upper respiratory illness three weeks ago with low-grade fever. Family reports new finger clubbing and he endorses frequent nocturnal cough but denies hemoptysis or chest pain. He is a former 40–pack-year smoker who quit two decades ago and has known hypertension. On prior clinic visit he was noted to have bibasilar crackles and exertional desaturation. He is being evaluated for possible interstitial lung disease/pulmonary fibrosis versus chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis given the subacute course."
P0183,"A 21-year-old woman presents with two days of sudden right-sided pleuritic chest pain and progressive shortness of breath, sharp with inspiration and worse on exertion. She notes scant blood-tinged sputum and mild pleuritic cough after a week-long upper respiratory illness. Three days ago she developed aching and swelling of the left calf following a long bus trip. She started combined oral contraceptives two months ago and smokes intermittently. She has a history of mild intermittent asthma but uses no inhaler regularly. On review she reports palpitations and lightheadedness but no fever or syncope. Symptoms suggest possible pulmonary embolism secondary to deep venous thrombosis, with asthma and recent viral bronchitis as potential confounders."
P0184,"A 92-year-old woman presents with seven days of progressively worsening dyspnea and a productive cough that began after a choking episode while eating ten days ago. Cough is mucoid with intermittent low-grade fevers, and she now complains of pleuritic right-sided chest discomfort with increased work of breathing. Family reports new intermittent confusion and reduced oral intake over the past 48 hours. She has a baseline history of COPD and chronic atrial fibrillation but states these symptoms are markedly worse than usual. At home she was noted to be more short of breath with minimal exertion and mildly hypoxemic. Clinical concern is for aspiration-related pneumonia precipitating a COPD exacerbation with superimposed hypoxemia."
P0185,"A 0-year-old female infant presents with three days of progressive cough and increased work of breathing after two days of clear rhinorrhea. Parents report intermittent fevers to 38.5°C and markedly decreased oral intake with poor latch. An older sibling had a recent upper respiratory illness. At home caregivers noted audible wheeze, shallow rapid respirations consistent with tachypnea, and visible subcostal retractions with feeding. A portable oximeter intermittently recorded saturations in the low 90s. There has been less urine output, raising concern for dehydration. No vomiting or rash. Born at term without known cardiac abnormalities. The presentation is most consistent with viral bronchiolitis complicated by mild hypoxemia, significant feeding intolerance, and evolving respiratory distress."

P0187,
P0188,"A 62-year-old woman reports two months of progressive exertional dyspnea and marked reduction in exercise tolerance, now awakening twice weekly with paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and needing two pillows for sleep. She notes new bilateral ankle swelling and a sense of abdominal fullness with early satiety. Over the past three weeks she has had intermittent palpitations with an irregular, rapid sensation and brief episodes of exertional chest tightness that resolve with rest. Symptoms began after a period of increasing fatigue and have gradually limited daily activities. She has a long history of hypertension and no recent fever or cough. There is no focal weakness or leg pain suggestive of DVT."
P0189,"A 34-year-old woman presents with progressive shortness of breath for 48 hours, sharp right-sided pleuritic chest pain, and a single small episode of hemoptysis. Symptoms began after a 10-hour long-haul flight five days ago; she also describes a week of worsening right calf swelling and tenderness. She endorses intermittent palpitations and lightheadedness with minimal exertion but denies fever or purulent cough. She uses combined oral contraceptives and reports two prior first-trimester miscarriages without a diagnosed coagulopathy. She is increasingly limited by dyspnea when climbing stairs. Given the temporal relationship to travel, unilateral calf symptoms, and oxygen desaturation on moderate activity, she is concerned for deep venous thrombosis with possible pulmonary embolism."
P0190,"A 31-year-old male recreational runner reports two weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and intermittent central chest tightness that began after a febrile upper respiratory illness. Symptoms are worse with climbing stairs and are accompanied by episodic palpitations and one brief presyncopal spell while exercising. He also notes new mild bilateral ankle swelling and orthopnea overnight, and a persistent dry cough. Chest discomfort is pressure-like, non-radiating, and improves somewhat with rest. He denies prior cardiac disease, tobacco use, or recent travel. Family history is noncontributory. Examination at home revealed a noticeably reduced exercise tolerance. He is concerned about a possible cardiac complication after the recent viral illness, given the combination of dyspnea, palpitations, edema, and near-syncope."
P0191,"A 13-year-old boy presents with six days of progressive gait instability and slurred speech. Symptoms began three days after a febrile upper respiratory illness; parents first noticed unsteady truncal ataxia and frequent falls, then new horizontal nystagmus. He now has intermittent occipital headache and two morning episodes of nonbloody vomiting. At urgent care he demonstrated left-sided limb dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia; there is no focal sensory loss. He has had low-grade fevers but no neck stiffness, rash, or recent head trauma. He has never had seizures and is not on any chronic medications. Parents report worsening coordination with handwriting and difficulty negotiating stairs, prompting urgent neurologic evaluation."
P0192,"An 85-year-old man presents with sudden left-sided weakness and slurred speech beginning approximately 14 hours ago. Symptoms were maximal at onset and he now has dense left hemiparesis with right-sided facial droop and difficulty swallowing; family notes intermittent confusion since the event. Earlier the same morning he experienced a transient monocular visual loss in the right eye that resolved in minutes. Past history is notable for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and long-standing hypertension, with a prior brief TIA last year. On initial exam there was a right carotid bruit. No recent fever, trauma, or anticoagulant changes. The temporal pattern and embolic risk factors suggest an acute ischemic cerebrovascular event."
P0193,"An 11-year-old girl presents with three episodes over the past two weeks of severe left-sided throbbing headache with transient right-sided weakness. Each event began with a shimmering visual aura and blurred vision, progressed to photophobia and nausea with occasional vomiting, and included transient expressive aphasia and mild gait instability; deficits resolved over 30–90 minutes. Mother reports the first episode occurred five days after a febrile upper respiratory illness. There is no history of seizures, head trauma, or chronic illness, and she has had normal developmental milestones and school performance. No recent medication changes or toxin exposures. Parents are concerned about recurrent focal neurologic symptoms and progressive headache intensity, prompting emergency evaluation."
P0194,"A 1-year-old male is brought for four days of progressive cough and noisy breathing after a sibling’s runny nose at daycare. Parents report rhinorrhea and intermittent low-grade fever for three days, then worsening tachypnea and audible wheeze with feeding yesterday. He is fussier, taking smaller feeds and producing fewer wet diapers. On exertion and with coughing he has brief perioral pallor and increased work of breathing with intercostal retractions. At home he had one vomiting episode after coughing. On brief otoscopic check the right tympanic membrane appeared erythematous. No prior chronic lung disease; born at term with mild eczema. Concern is for viral bronchiolitis versus early viral pneumonia or reactive airways exacerbation with hypoxemia requiring observation."
P0195,"An 86-year-old man presents with six months of progressive gait instability characterized by short, shuffling steps and difficulty initiating ambulation, with three falls in the past month. Family reports insidious short-term memory decline and increased apathy over four months; he has developed urinary urgency and occasional urge incontinence over the past two months. Neurologic exam has been notable for a magnetic, broad-based gait and slowed heel-to-toe progression. A recent noncontrast head CT performed in clinic demonstrated ventriculomegaly without acute infarct. Past medical history notable for longstanding hypertension and known benign prostatic hyperplasia, neither of which fully explains the constellation. Symptoms have resulted in reduced independence and need for home assistance."

P0202,"An 8-year-old girl presents with a two-week history of progressively worse headaches and intermittent visual disturbance. Headaches are diffuse and pressure-like, most severe on awakening and with bending forward, and are accompanied by nausea and photophobia. Parents describe brief transient graying or blurring of vision when she stands and occasional morning vomiting. She also reports a new rhythmic whooshing in both ears. Symptoms began after a recent uncomplicated sinus infection. At a school visit she squinted while reading; outpatient ophthalmology documented bilateral optic disc swelling. She has no fever, neck stiffness, focal weakness, or prior neurologic history. Family denies head trauma. Parents are particularly worried about the evolving visual symptoms and persistent morning headaches."
P0203,"A 36-year-old man reports six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and intermittent palpitations, now limiting his ability to climb one flight of stairs. He describes orthopnea requiring two pillows and two episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea with nocturnal, nonproductive cough. He has noticed new bilateral ankle swelling and early fatigue; on several occasions he felt lightheaded and nearly syncope during exertion. He denies persistent chest pain at rest but endorses brief pleuritic chest discomfort after heavy activity. He recalls a viral upper respiratory illness a few months earlier followed by prolonged malaise. He has no history of diabetes or chronic lung disease, drinks alcohol socially on weekends, and is not taking regular medications. Symptoms are most consistent with evolving cardiomyopathy and decompensated heart failure."
P0204,"A 32-year-old woman reports five days of progressive exertional dyspnea and sharp right-sided pleuritic chest pain that began shortly after a seven-hour flight. Pain is worse with deep inspiration and coughing; she has noted scant hemoptysis and intermittent lightheadedness on exertion. She also reports palpitations and subjective tachycardia without fever. Over the past two days she developed new swelling and tenderness of the right calf. Past history is notable for childhood-onset intermittent asthma, usually controlled with occasional albuterol inhaler, and she uses combined oral contraceptives. She denies recent infection, surgery, or pregnancy and does not smoke. Symptoms minimally improved with rest; the temporal cluster of recent immobilization, unilateral calf swelling, pleuritic pain, dyspnea, and hemoptysis raises concern for thromboembolic disease."
P0205,"A 70-year-old woman presents with five days of progressive dyspnea and productive cough after a week-long upper respiratory illness; she reports purulent sputum, right-sided pleuritic chest pain that worsens with deep inspiration, and low-grade fevers. Symptoms began gradually but acutely worsened with exertion over the last two days, now causing significant activity limitation. She notes new swelling and aching of the left calf and intermittent lightheadedness. Past medical history includes COPD and hypertension; she is a former 40-pack-year smoker. She denies orthopnea, palpitations, or recent travel. On review, she describes increased fatigue and poor appetite. The temporal pattern raises concern for a COPD exacerbation versus pneumonia with possible thromboembolic complication."

Family notes a broad-based, somewhat magnetic gait with two recent falls and growing difficulty initiating steps; she has developed urinary urgency with occasional leakage. Cognitive changes include worsening short-term memory and apathy that interfere with daily tasks. She had an acute decline after a recent urinary tract infection. Past medical history is notable for long-standing hypertension and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Neurologic exam demonstrates slowed processing without focal cranial nerve deficits. Prior brain imaging showed periventricular white matter disease. Differential considerations include normal-pressure hydrocephalus versus vascular cognitive impairment, with recurrent falls and incontinence posing the main safety concerns."
P0220,"A 49-year-old woman reports six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a productive cough that acutely worsened three days ago with new pleuritic right-sided chest pain and scant hemoptysis. She notes greenish sputum and intermittent low-grade fevers during the subacute course. Two weeks ago she endured prolonged travel and developed mild unilateral calf swelling; she also has a remote postpartum deep venous thrombosis. Past medical history is notable only for well-controlled hypertension. She now becomes short of breath after climbing a single flight of stairs and feels more fatigued with ordinary activities. She denies recent upper respiratory infection, night sweats, or rash, and seeks evaluation because the combination of chest pain, blood‑tinged sputum, and progressive dyspnea is new and concerning."
P0221,"A 64-year-old man presents with five days of progressive shortness of breath and a new, sharp right-sided pleuritic chest pain. He developed a dry cough with scant hemoptysis and low-grade fevers beginning three days ago and notes marked fatigue with minimal exertion; walking upstairs now causes lightheadedness and desaturation. One week prior he experienced new swelling and tenderness of the right calf after a long car trip. Past history includes COPD and hypertension with a remote 40-pack-year smoking history; he denies recent surgery or known malignancy. He has intermittent palpitations but no syncope. Examination findings are consistent with possible pulmonary embolism with small pleural effusion versus COPD exacerbation, prompting urgent imaging."
P0222,A 23-year-old female presents with acute dyspnea and pleuritic left-sided chest pain for three days. Symptoms began after a 10-hour flight and have progressed; she notes sudden onset shortness of breath at rest and sharp pain worse with inspiration. She reports a nonproductive cough and scant hemoptysis. She also noticed swelling and aching in her left calf over 48 hours. She has intermittent palpitations and lightheadedness but no fever or sputum production. She takes combined oral contraception and recently recovered from a sinus infection two weeks ago. No prior thrombotic history. Denies smoking or illicit drug use. Family history noncontributory.

P0225,"A 9-year-old girl presents with a three-month history of persistent cough and increasing shortness of breath with exertion. Symptoms began after a winter viral URI and have progressed over the last two weeks, with nocturnal coughing that wakes her twice weekly and intermittent wheeze heard by parents. Cough is worse with exercise and cold air; she reports throat tightness and noisy inhalation during sports consistent with paroxysms of dyspnea. She has known seasonal allergic rhinitis and a history of recurrent sinusitis, most recently treated with a short antibiotic course, and reports occasional chest tightness relieved partially by her school rescue inhaler. No fevers or weight loss. No prior hospitalizations. Concern is for reactive airways disease with exercise-induced bronchospasm and possible paradoxical vocal fold motion contributing to persistent cough."
P0226,
P0227,"A 19-year-old woman reports a six-week history of daily, pulsatile occipital headaches that usually begin within minutes of standing and can last several hours. Episodes are commonly preceded by a transient scintillating visual aura and associated with photophobia, nausea, and a sense of neck tightness. She also describes orthostatic lightheadedness with palpitations and two near-syncope events while standing from seated position. Symptoms began after a viral upper respiratory illness and have progressively worsened with exertion. She notes long-standing joint hypermobility and occasional unexplained fainting as a teenager. She denies focal weakness, fever, or recent head trauma. Symptoms limit attending classes and provoke anxiety about future collapses."
P0228,"A 77-year-old man with known COPD and hypertension presents with eight days of progressive dyspnea and a worsening productive cough. He reports greenish sputum, intermittent low-grade fevers, and new right-sided pleuritic chest pain that is worse with deep inspiration; he denies frank hemoptysis. Baseline exertional tolerance has declined markedly, and he notes audible wheeze and increased use of his rescue inhaler. Symptoms began after a brief viral upper respiratory illness two weeks ago and have steadily worsened, now causing shortness of breath with minimal activity. Family noticed mild ankle swelling over the past week. Clinical concern is for COPD exacerbation complicated by bacterial pneumonia with possible small parapneumonic effusion; no recent travel or known sick contacts."
P0229,"A 14-year-old male presents with two weeks of intermittent horizontal diplopia and progressive left ptosis. Symptoms began after a self-limited upper respiratory infection with sore throat and nasal congestion three weeks ago. Diplopia is binocular, worse in the evenings and with sustained reading, and partially improves after rest. He reports fatigable chewing and mild choking on liquids at night but denies fever, headache, or focal numbness. Parents note increased eyelid droop after sports practice. He also describes difficulty sustaining upgaze on prolonged tasks. No antecedent trauma or chronic illness. The pattern of fluctuating ocular and bulbar weakness raises concern for a neuromuscular junction disorder such as juvenile myasthenia gravis."
P0230,"A 24-year-old woman presents with ten days of progressive neurologic symptoms beginning as painless blurred vision in her right eye that evolved into periorbital pain with eye movement and intermittent diplopia. Three days after the visual change she developed tingling and numbness in the right arm and intermittent electric shocks down the spine with neck flexion consistent with Lhermitte phenomenon. Over the past week she has noticed unsteady gait, decreased coordination on the right, and new urinary urgency without dysuria. Symptoms began shortly after a self-limited upper respiratory illness two weeks ago. She denies head trauma, fevers now, or recent travel. No prior neurologic history; family history notable only for a maternal aunt with an autoimmune thyroid condition. She seeks evaluation for a unifying inflammatory or demyelinating process."
P0231,
P0232,"A 99-year-old man presents with four days of progressively worsening dyspnea and a new productive cough after an episode of choking while eating. He has known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and describes increased sputum production that is yellow-green, associated with low-grade fevers and decreased appetite. He notes new orthopnea and worsening bilateral lower extremity swelling over the past 48 hours. At baseline he ambulated with a cane; now he is resting frequently with shortness of breath and intermittent confusion. Family reports audible wheeze and one brief episode of coughing up a small amount of blood. No chest pain or syncope. The clinical picture is most suggestive of aspiration-related pneumonia superimposed on COPD with hypoxia and possible volume overload."
P0233,"A 13-year-old male presents with a three-week history of progressive morning headaches, described as pressure-like and worse with coughing or bending. Over the past two days he developed intermittent binocular horizontal diplopia and brief transient visual obscurations on standing. He also reports pulsatile tinnitus in the ears and frequent associated nausea with two episodes of vomiting. Headaches are moderately photophobic but not migrainous in throbbing quality; ibuprofen provided temporary relief. Two weeks ago he had a presumed viral sinus infection with nasal congestion. Mother reports he was seen at a local ED last week where the discharge note documented bilateral optic disc swelling. No fever, neck rigidity, or focal limb weakness noted."
P0234,"A 43-year-old male presents with four days of progressive shortness of breath and a sharp, right-sided pleuritic chest pain that began acutely after a 10-hour car trip. Dyspnea is worse with exertion and accompanied by scant hemoptysis and mild pleuritic positional chest discomfort. He notes progressive swelling and tenderness of the left calf since the trip. Onset was preceded by a week of nasal congestion but no fever. Past medical history notable for well-controlled hypertension and a 20-pack-year smoking history; BMI 32. He denies recent surgery or anticoagulation. At home he noticed palpitations and lightheadedness. Concern is high for deep venous thrombosis with pulmonary embolism given immobilization, unilateral calf edema, tachycardia, pleuritic pain, and hemoptysis."
P0235,"A 65-year-old woman presents with six-week history of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent nonproductive cough. She notes breathlessness with walking up one flight of stairs and two recent near-syncope episodes when climbing; she also reports new right ankle and calf swelling and mild intermittent pleuritic chest tightness on exertion. She had an unprovoked left lower-extremity DVT four months ago treated with a three-month course of anticoagulation. On recent exam she described neck fullness and palpitations, and a prominent pulmonic component of the second heart sound was documented. Portable pulse oximeter readings drop into the mid-80s with minimal activity. The presentation raises concern for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension with exercise-induced hypoxemia and evolving right-heart strain."
P0236,"A 56-year-old woman presents with a six-month history of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent, initially dry but now intermittently productive cough. Symptoms began insidiously after several upper respiratory infections and have worsened despite inhaler trials, with markedly reduced exercise tolerance and a three-kg unintentional weight loss. She reports intermittent low-grade fevers, nocturnal cough related to reflux, and occasional pleuritic chest discomfort but denies hemoptysis. She has a 20 pack-year smoking history and a remote diagnosis of limited systemic sclerosis, raising concern for connective-tissue–related interstitial lung disease. On review she notes increased breathlessness with stair climbing and new finger clubbing at home; prior outpatient chest radiograph reportedly showed basilar prominence. She prefers outpatient evaluation for pulmonary fibrosis vs chronic aspiration-related lung injury."
P0237,"A 99-year-old female presents with three weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a worsening nonproductive cough. She reports new orthopnea and two episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea after a recent viral upper respiratory illness, and family notes increasing lower-extremity swelling and decreased exercise tolerance. She has a long-standing interstitial lung disease, presumed idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, with a chronic dry cough that acutely worsened. Home pulse irregularity suggests atrial fibrillation and she carries a history of hypertension. On exam she has bibasilar crackles and dependent edema. The temporal pattern and findings are most consistent with decompensated cardiopulmonary disease—exacerbation of underlying fibrosis with superimposed volume overload and atrial arrhythmia—prompting urgent assessment of oxygenation, volume status, and rhythm."
P0238,"A 90-year-old female reports three months of progressive gait instability and cognitive slowing, with marked worsening over the past three weeks after a recent urinary tract infection. She describes small, shuffling steps with difficulty initiating gait and frequent turning pauses; she has fallen twice at home. Family notes intermittent confusion, short-term memory loss, and decreased conversational output. She also endorses urinary urgency and occasional daytime incontinence. A prior noncontrast head CT reportedly showed ventriculomegaly. She has a long history of hypertension and osteoarthritis but denies focal limb weakness, new headache, fever, or visual change. Symptoms interfere with dressing and transfers, and she now requires more assistance with ambulation."
P0239,"A 99-year-old female presents with seven days of progressive, painless loss of central vision in the right eye described as a dark central scotoma and distortion of faces and print. Symptoms began after two weeks of new temporal headaches, scalp tenderness when brushing hair, and intermittent jaw claudication with chewing. She reports low-grade fevers and generalized fatigue and notes several months of morning shoulder stiffness consistent with prior polymyalgia rheumatica. Primary care documented a markedly elevated inflammatory marker and noted right temporal artery prominence and tenderness on exam, prompting urgent referral. Past ocular history includes bilateral cataracts; medical history notable for long-standing hypertension. Concern is arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy from presumed giant cell arteritis; she denies trauma, diplopia, or eye pain."
P0240,
P0241,"A healthy-appearing 18-year-old male presents with sudden onset right-sided pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea that began while playing basketball yesterday evening. The pain is sharp, worse with deep inspiration, and associated with a dry cough and intermittent wheeze; he denies trauma or fever. Two weeks prior he experienced a self-limited upper respiratory illness. He admits occasional nicotine vaping. He reports lightheadedness and persistent breathlessness at rest. Prehospital assessment noted tachycardia. On exam there are decreased breath sounds and hyperresonance to percussion over the right hemithorax, findings concerning for a primary spontaneous pneumothorax. He has no prior hospitalizations and no family history of lung disease."
P0242,"A 16-year-old female varsity soccer player presents with progressive exertional shortness of breath and wheeze over the past ten days, worse since a week-long viral upper respiratory illness that followed a weekend tournament. She describes chest tightness with jogging and nocturnal cough awakening her twice weekly, and reports using her rescue inhaler more frequently than usual. Symptoms are reproducible with sprinting and there is mild throat tightness and occasional inspiratory noisy breathing at maximal effort, raising concern for exercise-induced bronchospasm with possible paradoxical vocal cord motion. She has a history of physician-diagnosed asthma and seasonal allergic rhinitis but no prior hospitalizations. Symptoms limit practices and school gym; denies fever, hemoptysis, or syncope."
P0243,A 93-year-old man reports ten days of progressive dyspnea and cough that began after a brief choking episode while eating; cough is productive of mucopurulent sputum with intermittent low-grade fevers and decreased appetite. He notes worsening exertional desaturation and now requires extra pillows overnight for breathlessness. Home baseline includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and long-standing hypertension. Over the past 48 hours he developed palpitations and lightheadedness; emergency evaluation documented hypoxemia and new atrial fibrillation with an irregularly rapid pulse. On exam at home he has increased work of breathing and coarse bibasilar crackles. Concern is for aspiration pneumonia precipitating a COPD exacerbation with secondary hypoxemia and arrhythmia. He denies chest pain or focal neurologic symptoms.
P0244,"An 11-year-old female reports two weeks of increasing polyuria and polydipsia with an unintentional 5–6 kg weight loss, now acutely worse over the past 48 hours with persistent nausea, intermittent vomiting, and diffuse abdominal pain. Parents note progressive fatigue and recent lethargy at school; she has had poor oral intake since symptoms intensified. Over the last day she developed rapid, deep breathing and appeared flushed between emesis episodes. There is no known prior metabolic disease; family history is notable for maternal autoimmune thyroid disease. Triage exam was concerning for dehydration and tachypnea. The chronology and cluster of symptoms are most consistent with new-onset autoimmune type 1 diabetes with concern for evolving diabetic ketoacidosis."
P0245,"A 71-year-old man reports a six-month history of progressive balance disturbance and cognitive slowing, now notable for short, magnetic steps and difficulty initiating gait. He describes increasing apathy, slowed speech, and impaired multitasking, with three near-falls and one fall last month without head injury. Family notes new urinary urgency with occasional urge incontinence. Symptoms acutely worsened after a treated urinary tract infection three weeks ago. Noncontrast CT performed last week showed ventriculomegaly out of proportion to cortical atrophy. Past medical history notable for long-standing hypertension. Neurology was consulted for suspected normal-pressure hydrocephalus versus mixed degenerative disease; he now requires a cane and assistance with several activities of daily living."
P0246,"A 60-year-old man reports an eight-week history of progressive exertional dyspnea and persistent nonproductive cough, beginning after a bronchitis-like illness. Symptoms have steadily limited his walking tolerance; he now desaturates with minimal exertion and notes low-grade fevers and reduced appetite. He denies chest pain but has noticed increasing bilateral ankle swelling. Past history is notable for treated hypertension and a 40 pack-year smoking history. On exam he has digital clubbing, bibasilar inspiratory crackles, and mild resting hypoxemia with greater desaturation on ambulation; there is 1+ pitting edema of the ankles. Clinically there is concern for a developing interstitial lung process with possible secondary pulmonary vascular involvement."
P0247,
P0248,"A 27-year-old female reports five days of progressive blurred central vision in the right eye accompanied by aching with eye movement and increased photophobia. She describes colors appearing washed, a small central gray spot, and intermittent holocephalic headache that is distinct from her baseline migraines. Two weeks ago she had a self-limited viral upper respiratory illness. She also noticed a brief episode of left-leg numbness and tingling yesterday that resolved after an hour. No trauma, purulent discharge, or fever. Past medical history notable for occasional migraine without aura; family history positive for autoimmune thyroid disease. Symptoms are worsening, impairing work and driving, and she is most concerned about ongoing visual decline and intermittent paresthesia."
P0249,"An 82-year-old woman reports 10 days of progressively worsening dyspnea and a productive cough that began after a presumed upper respiratory infection. Sputum was initially clear but turned yellowish and she has had intermittent low-grade fevers and fatigue. During the past three days she developed orthopnea and new bilateral lower extremity swelling, with marked reduction in exercise tolerance and breathlessness on minimal exertion. She also notes recent palpitations and an irregular sensation in her chest. At home she observed transient exertional desaturation. She denies chest pain or hemoptysis. Past medical history is notable for hypertension. On exam she describes bibasilar inspiratory crackles limiting deep breaths and reduced oral intake secondary to shortness of breath."
P0250,"An 83-year-old man presents with a 10-day history of progressive exertional dyspnea and right-sided pleuritic chest pain. He initially developed a dry cough after a recent upper respiratory illness, then noted new low‑grade fevers and decreasing exercise tolerance; over the past 48 hours he is short of breath at rest. He also reports recent swelling and aching of the right calf. His past history includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. He describes intermittent lightheadedness but denies chest pressure typical of ischemia. At baseline he uses a cane and reports greater orthopnea than usual. The presentation raises concern for acute pulmonary embolism or superimposed pneumonia on chronic lung disease with hypoxemia."
P0251,"A 46-year-old man reports three months of progressive exertional dyspnea and markedly reduced exercise tolerance, now limiting him to brief walks. Symptoms began insidiously after an unprovoked left lower-extremity DVT last year and have been accompanied by intermittent pleuritic chest discomfort and scant hemoptysis on two occasions. He describes presyncopal lightheadedness with exertion and occasional palpitations. Nighttime snoring, daytime fatigue, and obesity suggest possible untreated obstructive sleep apnea contributing to dyspnea. He is a former smoker with 15 pack-years. There is episodic unilateral leg swelling but no fever or infectious symptoms. The clinical picture raises concern for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension or persistent thromboembolic disease versus asthma exacerbation, and he wishes to proceed with cardiopulmonary evaluation."
P0252,"A 93-year-old woman presents with a three-month history of progressive gait disturbance and cognitive slowing. Family reports a magnetic, shuffling gait with short steps and hesitation, reduced short-term memory, and increasing apathy. Over the past month she sustained two ground-level falls without loss of consciousness and developed new urinary urgency with occasional daytime incontinence. Caregivers also note difficulty with sequencing tasks and occasional orthostatic lightheadedness on rising. She denies focal limb weakness, chest pain, or fever. On exam she is mildly bradyphrenic with a broad-based gait and unsteady turns. Clinicians are considering normal-pressure hydrocephalus versus chronic small-vessel vascular cognitive impairment as contributors; fall risk mitigation and assessment for reversible causes, including dehydration or urinary infection, have been initiated."
P0253,
P0254,"A 66-year-old woman reports five days of intermittent vertigo and progressive slurred speech with worsening right-sided limb clumsiness. Symptoms began as brief lightheaded spells after a recent mild upper respiratory illness one week ago and have evolved into persistent unsteadiness with two near-falls; she endorses nausea and brief episodes of horizontal diplopia, worse with head rotation and on standing. She denies chest pain or focal numbness. Past medical history is notable for hypertension and recently documented paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. On self-assessment she notes right-hand coordination difficulty and audible dysarthria when fatigued. Family observed transient improvement between episodes before deterioration. Current concern is posterior circulation ischemia given cerebellar signs and vascular risk factors; she was referred urgently for neuroimaging and cardiology evaluation."

P0279,"A 60-year-old male reports three months of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent nonproductive cough, with marked worsening over the past four weeks. Initially short of breath only with stair climbing, he now becomes breathless after walking two blocks and notes an 8-pound unintentional weight loss and increasing fatigue. He denies fevers, night sweats, chest pain, or hemoptysis. He has reproducible oxygen desaturation into the high 80s with moderate exertion. Exam has bilateral bibasilar inspiratory ""Velcro"" crackles and early digital clubbing. Past history notable for well-controlled hypertension; 20 pack-year former smoker with prior construction work and possible silica exposure. Clinical concern is progressive interstitial lung disease, most consistent with pulmonary fibrosis, prompting urgent pulmonary evaluation."
P0280,"A 59-year-old man reports three months of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough that have accelerated over the past two weeks, now limiting him to short walks. He notes an 8-pound unintentional weight loss and intermittent low-grade fevers but denies hemoptysis or chest pain. Office exam revealed fine bibasilar inspiratory crackles and early digital clubbing; pulse oximetry falls from 97% at rest to 88% with minimal ambulation. He is a former smoker with a history of well-controlled hypertension. Given the subacute course, clubbing, crackles, and exertional desaturation, the team is concerned about interstitial lung disease—most suspicious for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis—and has arranged pulmonary function testing and a high-resolution chest CT."
P0281,"A 66-year-old woman reports progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough for approximately six months, with more rapid decline over the past three weeks after a brief upper respiratory illness. She notes increasing fatigue and an unintentional 5-kg weight loss; denies fever or hemoptysis. Examination at a recent clinic visit documented bibasilar crackles and early digital clubbing. She becomes breathless with minimal ambulation and reports her oxygen saturation falls with exertion. A prior outpatient chest CT reportedly showed bibasilar reticular change and mild traction bronchiectasis, prompting concern for interstitial lung disease; she has a history of well-controlled hypertension. No history of tobacco use or occupational dust exposure is elicited."
P0282,"A 24-year-old woman presents with five days of progressive right-sided pleuritic chest pain and exertional shortness of breath. Pain is sharp, worse with deep inspiration, and associated with a nonproductive cough and two episodes of scant hemoptysis. She notes palpitations and near-syncope on ambulation; on exertion she becomes markedly dyspneic. She returned from a 14-hour bus trip one week ago and started combined oral contraceptives two months earlier. She also had an upper respiratory infection with nasal congestion and sore throat about ten days prior. Over the last 48 hours she developed mild swelling and tenderness in her left calf. Childhood intermittent asthma is noted but she has been otherwise healthy."
P0283,"An 82-year-old woman presents with six months of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough, now worse over the past week with intermittent low-grade fevers and decreased appetite. She reports a 10-pound unintentional weight loss and notes difficulty climbing one flight of stairs that was previously tolerated. History is significant for seropositive rheumatoid arthritis and a remote 20 pack-year smoking history, quit decades ago. On exam she notes finger clubbing and reports home oximetry falls into the high 80s with minimal exertion; she endorses basal crackling sensations rather than wheeze. The pattern suggests chronic fibrotic interstitial lung disease likely related to connective tissue disease, with recent acute symptom exacerbation possibly from superimposed infection or progressive fibrosis."
P0284,"A 63-year-old male reports progressive exertional dyspnea and a chronic productive cough that has worsened over six weeks. He describes years of morning sputum production consistent with chronic bronchitic symptoms but now notes new scant hemoptysis and an unintentional seven-pound weight loss over two months. Five days ago he developed acute right-sided pleuritic chest pain and an abrupt increase in shortness of breath following a prolonged automobile trip. He is a former 40-pack-year smoker with a history of hypertension. He denies fevers or night sweats but reports decreased exercise tolerance, intermittent wheeze, and loss of appetite. He is concerned this represents a new complication—possible pulmonary embolism, infection, or malignancy—and requests urgent evaluation."

There has been mild new imbalance on stairs and a single fall without loss of consciousness. Symptoms began after a febrile upper respiratory infection three weeks ago. No prior seizures or head trauma. Past history notable only for eczema. Family history is positive for migraine in a maternal aunt. Parents report no recent medication changes or toxin exposures."
P0294,A 42-year-old woman presents with five days of progressive exertional dyspnea and pleuritic right-sided chest pain. The dyspnea began as mild breathlessness on climbing stairs and has progressed to shortness of breath at rest; chest pain is sharp and worse with deep inspiration. She reports a dry cough with occasional scant hemoptysis and low-grade fevers. Two days ago she noticed right calf swelling and aching after a prolonged intercity bus trip two weeks earlier; she has longstanding varicose veins. She is a former light smoker and has treated hypothyroidism. No recent trauma. Symptoms are worse with exertion and improved slightly when upright. She denies orthopnea and is concerned for pulmonary embolism versus infectious pneumonia.
P0295,"A 45-year-old woman with a remote history of mild asthma reports one week of progressive exertional dyspnea and right-sided pleuritic chest pain that began two days ago. The pain is sharp, worse with deep inspiration, and associated with a productive cough producing yellow sputum with occasional blood-tinged streaks. She describes intermittent low-grade fevers, decreased exercise tolerance, and recurrent wheeze not relieved by her inhaler. Symptoms began after a recent upper respiratory illness and followed a prolonged car trip the prior week. She denies focal leg swelling or calf pain. She is concerned about a blood clot versus a complicated pneumonia given the hemoptysis and pleuritic pain; plans were made for urgent imaging and oxygen titration based on clinical exam."
P0296,"A 40-year-old woman presents with a six-week history of progressive epigastric pain and pronounced early satiety. Pain is crampy, worse after meals, and accompanied by nausea and intermittent non-bilious vomiting; she now tolerates only small, frequent meals. She notes a 10-pound unintentional weight loss and one episode of dark, tarry stool last week followed by increasing fatigue. She has a remote history of heartburn controlled intermittently with over-the-counter remedies and reports occasional NSAID use for menstrual cramps. No fevers or overt hematemesis. Physical exam earlier revealed mild epigastric tenderness and pallor. She is concerned about peptic ulcer disease or gastric outlet obstruction and was referred for endoscopic evaluation; iron-deficiency anemia is suspected given the symptoms."
P0297,"A 75-year-old woman reports two weeks of intermittent right-sided weakness, slurred speech, and brief episodes of expressive aphasia that initially lasted 10–20 minutes but have become more frequent and prolonged. Yesterday she had a three-hour episode with persistent mild right facial droop and unsteady gait, prompting evaluation. She endorses several recent near-falls and progressive difficulty managing stairs. She has a history of hypertension and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and notes recent palpitations without syncope. She denies headache, visual loss, or seizure activity. There is mild baseline memory decline but no acute confusion. Symptoms are not positional and were not preceded by trauma or infectious prodrome. Family reports the speech deficits are new and concerning for transient ischemic events."
P0298,"An 87-year-old female reports progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent nonproductive cough for approximately six months, initially with subtle decline in walking tolerance that has recently limited household ambulation. The cough is dry and worse with exertion; she also describes increasing fatigue, a 6-kg unintentional weight loss, and intermittent low‑grade fevers after a bronchitic illness two months ago. She notes occasional pleuritic chest discomfort and new digital clubbing, and home pulse oximetry readings fall into the low 80s with activity. Outpatient chest radiography reportedly showed basilar reticular changes; on exam she has fine inspiratory crackles at both bases. Overall presentation is most consistent with progressive interstitial lung disease, complicated by exertional hypoxemia and concern for secondary pulmonary hypertension."

P0300,
P0301,"A 7-year-old boy presents with a seven-day history of worsening cough and shortness of breath that began after a rhinorrheal illness with low-grade fever. Cough was initially intermittent and dry but has become paroxysmal and nocturnal, waking him twice most nights; parents note audible wheeze and reports of chest tightness when running. He now tires quickly during play and has avoided sports at school. Caregivers administered his rescue inhaler at home once with partial symptomatic relief. No vomiting, hemoptysis, or cyanosis. Past history is notable for atopic dermatitis and seasonal allergic rhinitis. No prior intubations or chronic lung disease. Family has seasonal allergies but no cystic fibrosis history."
P0302,
P0303,"A 70-year-old female presents with three weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a nonproductive cough that has worsened over the past 48 hours when she developed right-sided pleuritic chest pain and low‑grade fevers after a prolonged car trip. She now reports orthopnea and episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, plus new bilateral lower‑extremity swelling and intermittent palpitations with an irregular sensation in her chest. Symptoms began gradually but accelerated after the period of immobility; she is concerned about a blood clot but also notes increasing fatigue consistent with congestive symptoms. Past medical history is notable for hypertension and osteoarthritis. She denies recent cough with sputum, active tobacco use, or recent travel-associated illness other than the long drive."
P0304,"A 17-year-old male reports six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and intermittent chest tightness that occur during soccer practice and when exposed to cold air. He describes noisy breathing with episodic inspiratory stridor and throat tightness, accompanied by a dry cough and occasional hoarseness. Symptoms began after a presumed upper respiratory infection three months ago and now substantially reduce his exercise tolerance, though they improve with rest and coached breathing. He denies fever, syncope, hemoptysis, or leg swelling. Past history notable for seasonal allergic rhinitis; he denies tobacco or vaping. Examination at school revealed audible inspiratory noise during exertion. Differential considerations include exercise-induced bronchoconstriction versus paradoxical vocal fold motion; spirometry with bronchodilator challenge and outpatient laryngoscopy were requested."
P0305,"A 99-year-old male presents with sudden right-sided weakness and confusion for the past 24 hours. Family notes acute onset of slurred speech and expressive aphasia with a right facial droop; he is slower to follow commands than his baseline of mild vascular cognitive impairment. Caregiver reports a brief prodrome of decreased oral intake and low-grade fever with urinary frequency over three days, raising concern for a urinary tract infection and dehydration that may have precipitated symptoms. Past history is notable for long-standing hypertension and atrial fibrillation, increasing embolic stroke risk. No chest pain or shortness of breath. Examination findings are consistent with left hemispheric ischemia; goals are stabilization, stroke evaluation, and addressing infection and volume status."
P0306,"A 41-year-old female reports four days of progressive shortness of breath and sharp right-sided pleuritic chest pain that began three days after a long-haul flight. Dyspnea is worse with exertion and associated with intermittent palpitations and lightheadedness; she describes a dry cough with one episode of blood-tinged sputum. She also notes subjective fever and chills and new swelling and tenderness in the left calf. Past history is notable only for mild intermittent asthma; she takes combined oral contraceptives. She denies recent trauma, smoking, or illicit drug use. Symptoms have steadily worsened despite rest, and she became more breathless climbing stairs yesterday, prompting presentation for evaluation for possible pulmonary embolism versus infectious or inflammatory pulmonary process."
P0307,"A 94-year-old female presents with five days of progressive shortness of breath and a new productive cough after a choking episode while eating. The sputum is purulent and foul-smelling, and family reports low-grade fevers and reduced oral intake. She now becomes breathless at rest and intermittently requires supplemental oxygen for desaturation with minimal exertion. On exam there are coarse inspiratory crackles localized to the right lower lung and decreased air entry basally. Past medical history notable for COPD and chronic hypertension; she was previously independent with transfers. Clinical impression is aspiration-related pneumonia complicating underlying COPD, with concern for oropharyngeal dysphagia as the precipitant. No chest pain or hemoptysis reported; family wishes discussion of management options."
P0308,"A 24-year-old female reports three days of progressive exertional dyspnea, pleuritic right-sided chest pain, and a dry cough. She noted scant hemoptysis this morning and intermittent low-grade fevers. Symptoms began after a prolonged bus trip one week ago and were preceded by new right calf swelling and tenderness over two days. She takes combined oral contraceptives and has a maternal history of early venous clots. During activity she feels lightheaded and palpitates, and at rest notices a rapid heart rate. She denies recent surgery, trauma, or significant illness beforehand. The timing and constellation suggest possible deep venous thrombosis complicated by pulmonary embolism, and she seeks evaluation for hypoxia and acute cardiopulmonary compromise."
P0309,"A 29-year-old female presents with a 10-day history of progressive blurred vision in the right eye, associated with retro-orbital pain that worsens with eye movement and marked photophobia. She reports intermittent diplopia and new floaters with occasional flashes; morning headaches are more prominent and are occasionally accompanied by brief transient visual obscurations. Symptoms began after a self-limited upper respiratory infection two weeks ago and have steadily intensified. She also notes new low-frequency pulsatile tinnitus and episodic nausea with the worst headaches. She has a distant history of episodic migraine but describes this pain as different and more localized behind the right eye. No recent trauma, contact lens use, fever, or skin rash. Concern for optic neuritis versus raised intracranial pressure is expressed."
P0310,"A 64-year-old woman with hypertension and a remote 30-pack-year smoking history reports three weeks of worsening productive cough on a background of chronic COPD and known bronchiectasis. Cough initially produced clear sputum but became purulent with low-grade fevers and a two-pound weight loss; she notes increased dyspnea on exertion compared with baseline. Two days ago she developed acute, pleuritic right-sided chest pain and a single small episode of hemoptysis. She also describes new swelling and tenderness of the right calf. She denies chest pressure, syncope, or recent travel. The temporal progression—bronchiectasis/COPD exacerbation with fever and purulence, now acute pleuritic pain plus unilateral leg swelling—raises concern for superinfection and possible pulmonary embolism."
P0311,"A 71-year-old woman presents with six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough. Symptoms began insidiously and have worsened from breathlessness on stairs to needing frequent rest after short walks; she now sleeps on two pillows for orthopnea and reports one episode weekly of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. She has noticed a three-kilogram weight gain and new bilateral ankle swelling. She describes intermittent palpitations and family members noted an irregularly irregular pulse. On exam she reports basilar crackles and reduced exercise tolerance compared with her usual. Past medical history is notable for well-controlled hypertension. She denies chest pain, fever, hemoptysis, or recent travel."
P0312,"A 39-year-old female reports three weeks of progressive right-sided paresthesia and intermittent blurring of vision in the left eye. Symptoms began as fingertip tingling that ascended to involve the forearm, now accompanied by unsteady gait and frequent stumbling. She endorses an electric shock sensation with neck flexion and new urinary urgency with occasional hesitancy. Fatigue and mild cognitive slowing interfere with work. She recalls a febrile upper respiratory infection about six weeks ago but denies recent trauma or systemic infection currently. Past history notable only for episodic migraine without aura. The pattern raises concern for an inflammatory demyelinating process such as multiple sclerosis or focal transverse myelitis, prompting urgent neurologic evaluation."
P0313,"A 2-year-old male is brought for two days of progressive right ear pain and fever. Symptoms began after a week of nasal congestion and rhinorrhea; caregivers note increased fussiness and poor oral intake. Over the past 24 hours he developed high fevers to about 39.5°C, persistent otalgia, and new postauricular swelling with erythema and tenderness behind the right ear. This morning there was purulent otorrhea and caregivers report muffled responses to sound and reduced speech-like vocalizations. He has intermittent nonbilious vomiting and fewer wet diapers. No history of recurrent ear disease. Examination elsewhere reportedly documented a bulging right tympanic membrane. Clinical concern is acute otitis media complicated by mastoiditis, warranting urgent ENT evaluation."
P0314,
P0315,"A 48-year-old male presents with three months of progressive dysphagia initially to solids and now to liquids, accompanied by intermittent odynophagia and frequent regurgitation, worse when lying flat. He reports an eight-kilogram unintentional weight loss and diminished appetite. Longstanding heartburn treated intermittently with over-the-counter antacids preceded these symptoms for several years, and he has a prior diagnosis of Barrett’s esophagus on surveillance endoscopy. Over the past two weeks he developed a hoarse voice and nocturnal cough with occasional choking episodes. A recent workup documented iron-deficiency anemia. He smokes occasionally and denies fever or overt gastrointestinal bleeding. He is concerned about progressive obstruction versus malignant transformation and requests expedited evaluation."
P0316,"An 18-year-old female reports a six-week history of progressive palpitations, unintentional weight loss of about 6 kg, and persistent heat intolerance. She describes a fine hand tremor, fragmented sleep with early morning awakening, and increasing fatigue limiting her ability to climb stairs due to proximal leg weakness. Menstrual cycles have become irregular over the same interval. Symptoms began insidiously and accelerated after a brief viral upper respiratory illness one month ago. She notes intermittent lightheadedness during palpitations and new ocular irritation with upper lid retraction and mild protrusion of the right eye. She denies chest pain, syncope, or recent medication changes. Family history is noncontributory. Overall presentation is most consistent with a hyperadrenergic endocrine process."
P0317,
P0318,
P0319,"A 62-year-old woman reports six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent nonproductive cough that began after a brief upper respiratory illness. She now requires two pillows to sleep because of breathlessness, notes new bilateral lower extremity swelling, and experiences intermittent exertional chest tightness when climbing stairs. She is a former 30–pack-year smoker with long-standing hypertension and recalls prior outpatient documentation of 'lung scarring.' She denies fever, hemoptysis, or sputum production. Her walking tolerance has declined from a mile to a few blocks. The pattern suggests evolving cardiopulmonary disease—possible progression of interstitial lung disease with secondary pulmonary hypertension or occult heart failure—warranting chest imaging and BNP evaluation."
P0320,"A 73-year-old woman presents with a six-month history of progressive gait instability, cognitive slowing, and new urinary urgency. Her family notes difficulty initiating steps with short, shuffling, ""magnetic"" movements and two recent low-energy falls. Cognitive changes are mainly executive dysfunction and slowed processing with intermittent short-term memory lapses, requiring frequent reminders. Urinary urgency has progressed to occasional urge incontinence over the past two months. She has a remote fall with brief head trauma a year ago and a history of well-controlled hypertension. CT head performed by outpatient neurology shows ventriculomegaly without acute hemorrhage. Family reports transient improvement in gait and concentration after a large-volume lumbar puncture last month. The overall picture is most consistent with possible normal-pressure hydrocephalus."
P0321,"A 59-year-old man reports two months of progressively worsening exertional dyspnea and decreased exercise tolerance, now limiting his ability to climb a flight of stairs. He has a persistent, mostly dry morning cough with one episode of scant blood-tinged sputum and intermittent wheeze, worse with exertion. He notes new ankle swelling and mild right-sided chest discomfort when active. Symptoms began several months after a remote pulmonary embolism and longstanding history of chronic bronchitic cough related to a 35-pack-year smoking history. He endorses loud snoring and daytime somnolence consistent with possible obstructive sleep apnea. He denies fever or infection symptoms. Concern is for evolving pulmonary hypertension, chronic thromboembolic disease, or COPD progression prompting further cardiopulmonary evaluation."
P0322,"A 73-year-old male reports eight weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough that began insidiously after a bronchitis-like illness. He now becomes breathless walking one block and has had two episodes of scant hemoptysis. He describes fatigue, unintentional 10-pound weight loss, and diminished appetite. He is a former 40-pack-year smoker who quit a decade ago and has a history of hypertension, otherwise independent. On review he notes mild lower extremity swelling and uses two pillows at night for sleep. Examiners documented bibasilar crackles and mild pitting ankle edema. He denies fever, chest pain, or orthopnea beyond needing extra pillows; he is concerned about worsening exercise tolerance and progressive shortness of breath."
P0323,"A frail 86-year-old man presents with three months of progressive exertional dyspnea that has acutely worsened over the past two weeks. He notes a persistent dry cough and reports becoming short of breath after walking two blocks, with new lightheadedness on minimal exertion. He had a self-limited upper respiratory infection three weeks ago. On review he describes a 5-pound unintentional weight loss and decreased appetite. Past history notable for hypertension and a remote 40-pack-year smoking history. Home oxygen not used. On exam he reports exertional oxygen desaturation and exam previously documented bibasilar fine inspiratory crackles; no lower-extremity edema. He denies chest pain, hemoptysis, or fever and is worried about progressive lung disease."
P0324,"An 84-year-old man reports two weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea that has accelerated over the past three days, now occurring with minimal ambulation and at rest. He describes new orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, a persistent nonproductive cough, and mild fatigue. Symptoms began after a self-limited upper respiratory infection three weeks ago. At home he notes increased shortness of breath with decreased exercise tolerance and new ankle swelling. He is a former smoker with known hypertension and COPD, and this episode feels worse than prior ""bronchitis"" flares. On review he denies chest pain or syncope but endorses lightheadedness with exertion. Prior baseline required activity modification; today he appears more dyspneic and reports room-air oxygen saturation lower than usual."
P0325,"A 31-year-old female reports three weeks of progressive sensory changes and gait disturbance after a viral upper respiratory illness. She first noticed intermittent paresthesias in the right arm and leg that now cause numbness and difficulty buttoning clothes; bending the neck produces brief electric shocks consistent with Lhermitte's phenomenon. Two weeks in she developed blurring and pain with left eye movement suggestive of optic neuritis, and over the past week she has had urinary urgency and a spastic-appearing gait with several near-falls. She endorses mild fatigue but denies fever, headache, or recent head trauma. She recalls a transient episode of numbness last year that resolved. Neurologic process of demyelination is suspected; MRI and neuro-ophthalmology referral arranged."

P0329,"A 75-year-old woman presents with two weeks of progressively worsening exertional dyspnea and a three-night history of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea. Family reports new palpitations and intermittent lightheadedness beginning five days ago; she notes a recent upper respiratory cough that resolved. She has gained three pounds of edema and now has bilateral pitting lower-extremity swelling and decreased exercise tolerance. On review she endorses mild productive cough and chronic baseline dyspnea attributed to long-standing COPD and hypertension. Exam findings described by primary care include irregular heartbeat and bibasilar crackles. Past history notable for hypertension and stage III chronic kidney disease. She denies chest pain, syncope, or fever. Symptoms are most consistent with acute heart failure exacerbation, likely precipitated by new arrhythmia."
P0330,
P0331,"A 40-year-old man presents with four days of progressive exertional dyspnea and sharp right-sided pleuritic chest pain. He reports an episode of blood-tinged sputum yesterday and a persistent dry cough. Symptoms began two days after a ten-hour coach bus ride; he also notes new swelling and aching in the right calf for five days. He is a current tobacco smoker and has well-controlled hypertension. He denies fever, sputum purulence, or recent upper respiratory infection. He has intermittent exertional palpitations and lightheadedness on minimal activity. No history of bleeding disorder. Concern is raised for pulmonary embolism from probable deep venous thrombosis versus viral or bacterial pneumonia or an acute exacerbation of underlying airway disease."
P0332,"A 43-year-old woman presents with six weeks of progressive palpitations, tremor, and heat intolerance. She reports an 8-pound unintentional weight loss despite increased appetite and intermittent exertional dyspnea with lightheadedness. Episodes of rapid, irregular heartbeat are accompanied by fine hand tremor, excessive sweating, and difficulty concentrating at work. She notes new neck fullness and a sensation of throat tightness, plus episodic eye irritation with lid retraction and blurred vision. Menstrual cycles have become irregular over the past two months, and she describes mild proximal muscle weakness when climbing stairs. No prior thyroid disease. Symptoms began insidiously and worsen with minimal exertion; she denies chest pain, syncope, or recent medication changes."
P0333,"A 15-year-old boy presents with three days of progressive right-sided facial weakness and numbness that began two days after a viral upper respiratory illness. He notes difficulty closing the right eye, drooling, and altered taste on the anterior tongue, and reports new hyperacusis in the affected ear. Symptoms progressed over 48 hours then plateaued; he also has intermittent frontal headache and mild dysarthria when speaking fast. There is right-sided otalgia but no ear discharge, no skin vesicles, and no limb weakness or sensory change. He denies head trauma, fever currently, or recent travel or tick exposure. Family is concerned for acute facial nerve palsy (Bell’s palsy versus Ramsey Hunt), and he requests evaluation for causes and prognosis."
P0334,"A 97-year-old female reports a two-week history of progressive exertional dyspnea with new orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. She describes a persistent dry cough and a single brief episode of pleuritic chest discomfort. Family notes gradual anorexia and decreased mobility after a recently treated urinary tract infection, and she has noticed bilateral ankle swelling and increased fatigue. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and known diastolic heart failure; her pulse has felt irregular at home. She denies fever or purulent sputum. Presentation is most consistent with a congestive heart failure exacerbation in the setting of deconditioning, with concern for possible concomitant pulmonary embolism or aspiration-related lung injury given recent illness and reduced intake."
P0335,
P0336,"An 84-year-old woman reports three days of progressive, painless vision loss in the right eye, starting as blurred central vision and evolving to a persistent dark central spot that interferes with reading and facial recognition. She notes a two-week history of new temporal headaches and scalp tenderness, with jaw claudication when chewing and increasing fatigue; she has felt low-grade fevers over the past week. On exam the right temporal artery felt prominent and tender. Past medical history includes hypertension and prior polymyalgia rheumatica; she underwent cataract extraction in that eye two years ago. She denies trauma, flashes, or eye discharge. Symptoms began after a brief upper respiratory illness two weeks earlier, and she is most concerned about permanent vision loss."
P0337,
P0338,"A 93-year-old man presents with two weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a new productive cough. Family reports scant yellow sputum and intermittent low-grade fevers, with several episodes of coughing and choking while eating solids over the past month. He notes nocturnal cough and positional worsening when lying flat, plus decreased appetite and an unintentional 5-kg weight loss over three months. At baseline he has mild cognitive impairment and limited mobility from osteoarthritis. He has experienced episodic desaturation with minimal exertion and increasing dependence on assistance for meals. The cluster of dysphagia with recent choking, subacute constitutional symptoms, and bibasilar crackling cough suggests aspiration-related lower respiratory infection superimposed on chronic frailty; no recent antibiotic courses or hospitalizations are reported."
P0339,
P0340,"A 33-year-old woman reports ten days of progressive blurring and decreased vision in her left eye associated with a deep, aching retro-orbital pain that is worse with eye movement. She notes colors look ""washed out"" and recently developed difficulty reading fine print; her partner observed a sluggish left pupil in bright light. Symptoms began shortly after a self-limited upper respiratory illness and are exacerbated by hot showers or vigorous exercise. She also recalls a brief episode of right-leg numbness and tingling three months ago that resolved over days. There is no trauma, discharge, or floaters. Examined elsewhere she was told the finding might represent optic neuritis, raising concern for a demyelinating process such as multiple sclerosis."
P0341,"A 38-year-old female reports a two-week history of progressive exertional dyspnea and sharp, right-sided pleuritic chest pain. Symptoms began shortly after a 10–12 hour flight, initially with a dry cough and low-grade fevers, and she noticed new right calf swelling and aching five days later. Dyspnea worsens on climbing stairs and is associated with occasional lightheadedness; she has not had hemoptysis. She describes mild childhood asthma that has been quiescent for years and currently uses combined hormonal contraception. At home she observed mild breathlessness with minimal exertion and transient lightheadedness but no syncope. Given the temporal link with prolonged travel, focal calf swelling, and exertional desaturation, she is concerned about possible deep venous thrombosis with pulmonary embolism."
P0342,
P0343,"A 90-year-old female presents with a six-month history of progressive gait instability and cognitive slowing. She describes a magnetic, shuffling gait with decreased step height and several ground-level falls in the past month without loss of consciousness. Family notes increasing short-term memory loss, word-finding difficulty, and apathy limiting daily activities. She has new urinary urgency with occasional nocturnal incontinence. Symptoms progressed after a period of reduced mobility from painful hip osteoarthritis, and baseline peripheral sensory neuropathy has worsened balance. Medical history includes long-standing hypertension. Home observation revealed slowed responses and a broad-based gait; concern is raised for normal-pressure hydrocephalus versus mixed degenerative change. No fevers, chest pain, or focal seizure activity reported."
P0344,"A 34-year-old woman presents with three days of progressive dyspnea and sharp, right-sided pleuritic chest pain that began a day after a transcontinental flight. She reports an episode of frank hemoptysis yesterday and notes intermittent palpitations and lightheadedness. Two weeks ago she developed swelling and aching of the right calf that she attributed to travel. She uses combined hormonal contraception and smokes a half-pack daily; no prior thrombotic history. Onset was acute and symptoms have worsened with minimal exertion; she also has a low-grade fever and poor exercise tolerance. She denies recent trauma or known malignancy. The constellation is concerning for pulmonary embolism secondary to deep venous thrombosis."
P0345,"A 99-year-old female reports progressive gait instability and slowing over the past five months, describing a wide-based, shuffling walk and two recent near-falls. Family notes increasing forgetfulness and executive slowing with difficulty managing finances and sequencing tasks. She has new urinary urgency and occasional urge incontinence that began around the same time as the gait changes. She denies headache or acute focal weakness but reports lightheadedness on standing. Past history is notable for long-standing hypertension and peripheral neuropathy related to prior glucose intolerance. Providers have raised concern for normal-pressure hydrocephalus given the triad of gait disturbance, cognitive change, and urinary symptoms; orthostatic hypotension and multifactorial deconditioning are considered contributing factors. Neurology follow-up is planned."
P0346,"A 51-year-old woman presents with four days of progressive shortness of breath and right-sided pleuritic chest pain that began after a recent ankle fracture left her non–weight-bearing. Dyspnea worsens with exertion and is accompanied by a dry cough and a small amount of blood-tinged sputum. She notes new intermittent palpitations and had one feverish evening. She also reports swelling and tenderness of the right calf for two days. Past medical history is notable for well-controlled hypertension and intermittent exercise-related asthma. No recent long-distance travel. The temporal link to immobilization with unilateral leg swelling raises concern for deep venous thrombosis complicated by pulmonary embolism with pleuritic inflammation and minimal hemoptysis, prompting urgent evaluation."
P0347,"A 57-year-old woman presents with two weeks of progressively worsening exertional dyspnea and a dry cough that began after a mild upper respiratory infection. Symptoms have evolved to include intermittent pleuritic right-sided chest discomfort and a sense of breathlessness at rest over the past three days. She reports new unilateral calf swelling and aching after a prolonged car trip ten days ago, and notes decreased exercise tolerance compared with baseline. She is a former smoker with a history of hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea. There is no fever, hemoptysis is denied, and she has progressive fatigue and occasional nighttime awakenings from shortness of breath. She is concerned about a pulmonary embolus but also worried about chronic lung disease given her smoking history."
P0348,"A 72-year-old female reports a ten-day history of progressive exertional dyspnea and a dry cough that began after a presumed upper respiratory infection. Symptoms acutely worsened over 48 hours with new pleuritic right-sided chest pain and subjective fevers; she noticed new swelling and mild erythema of the right calf. She has known COPD, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension at baseline and limited mobility from knee osteoarthritis. On walking she becomes more short of breath and her oxygen saturation falls into the high 80s. She denies sputum production or orthopnea. The temporal cluster of calf swelling, pleuritic pain, hypoxemia, and acute dyspnea raises concern for pulmonary embolism versus COPD exacerbation."

P0356,"A 13-year-old boy presents with four days of progressive abdominal pain that began as vague periumbilical discomfort and migrated to the right lower quadrant over 24 hours. Pain is constant, sharp, and worsened by movement; he now walks stiffly and avoids running. He reports poor appetite, two episodes of non-bloody emesis, and a low-grade fever. Onset followed a mild sore throat and nasal congestion one week earlier. Parents note decreased urine output and less activity than usual. He has localized tenderness in the right lower quadrant with mild guarding but no visible rash or joint swelling. Differential considerations include acute appendicitis versus postinfectious mesenteric adenitis, and he requests evaluation for possible surgical abdomen."
P0357,"A 65-year-old woman presents with a three-week history of progressive exertional dyspnea and a productive cough that has become purulent. She reports intermittent blood-tinged sputum and new right-sided pleuritic chest pain for two days, with a subjective fever and increased fatigue. Symptoms acutely worsened after a prolonged car trip last weekend; she now notes mild swelling of the right calf and difficulty climbing a single flight of stairs. Past medical history is notable for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and long-standing hypertension, and a remote provoked deep venous thrombosis five years ago. She denies night sweats or weight loss. The constellation raises concern for infectious bronchitic exacerbation versus pulmonary embolism on a background of chronic lung disease."
P0358,"A 65-year-old man presents with progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough for several months, now limiting him to short walks and causing fatigue with minimal exertion. Symptoms began after a prolonged bronchitic illness and have insidiously worsened; he notes a two-month interval of accelerated breathlessness and intermittent mild weight loss. He is a former 30 pack-year smoker and has a history of well-controlled hypertension. On review he denies fevers, chest pain, or hemoptysis. Exam previously documented basilar inspiratory crackles and mild digital clubbing; home oxygen is not used but he reports breathlessness when climbing stairs and occasional lightheadedness. Prior outpatient evaluation raised concern for pulmonary fibrosis with exertional desaturation on walk testing."
P0359,"An 80-year-old female presents with six weeks of progressive gait instability and intermittent confusion, with a more pronounced decline over the past two weeks after a minor fall in which she struck her head but did not lose consciousness. Family notes slower recall, increasing daytime somnolence, new urinary urgency with occasional incontinence, and intermittent slurred speech accompanied by right-hand clumsiness. She reports two near-falls and now requires a walker for steadying. Past history is notable for atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, hypertension, and osteoarthritis. She denies fever, persistent headache, or vomiting but felt briefly dazed after the fall. Symptoms cluster around cognitive and motor dysfunction, prompting concern for a subacute intracranial process or cerebrovascular etiology."

P0363,"A 50-year-old male presents with a 10-day history of progressive exertional dyspnea that acutely worsened three days ago with pleuritic right-sided chest pain and scant hemoptysis. Symptoms began after a week-long car trip; he now notes new left calf swelling and discomfort. He describes palpitations and lightheadedness on exertion and has been more short of breath at rest, limiting walks to the block. He is a former 20 pack-year smoker and has a history of well-controlled hypertension. On review he denies fever or recent infection. The temporal sequence—prolonged travel, unilateral calf swelling, then sudden dyspnea with pleuritic pain and hemoptysis—raises concern for thromboembolic disease with possible right-heart strain."
P0364,"A 91-year-old female presents with a 48-hour history of progressive, painless loss of vision in the right eye, preceded by ten days of new, severe right-sided temporal headache and scalp tenderness. She endorses jaw claudication with chewing and several brief episodes of transient monocular visual blackout over the prior week (amaurosis fugax). For two months she has experienced morning stiffness and proximal shoulder girdle aching consistent with polymyalgia rheumatica, accompanied by intermittent low-grade fevers and decreased appetite. Past medical history is notable for longstanding hypertension. She denies ocular trauma or discharge; family reports the right pupil seemed sluggish. The constellation of symptoms raises concern for giant cell arteritis with possible ischemic optic neuropathy."
P0365,"A 95-year-old male reports six weeks of progressive gait difficulty with a broad-based, shuffling gait and increasing unsteadiness. He has fallen twice at home over the past month and now needs a cane for ambulation. Family also reports slowed thinking, short-term memory decline, and increased apathy over the same interval. Urinary urgency progressing to occasional incontinence began about four weeks ago. He had a presumed urinary tract infection treated at home two weeks ago, after which his gait and cognition acutely worsened. He denies new focal weakness, headache, or visual change but describes intermittent lightheadedness when standing. Past history is notable for long-standing hypertension. No recent hospitalizations or new medications."
P0366,"A 74-year-old female reports ten days of progressive left monocular vision loss, beginning as intermittent blurring and fleeting diplopia and evolving over 48 hours into a dense central scotoma. She describes associated left temporal scalp tenderness and new-onset jaw claudication with chewing. Examination at clinic noted a palpable, slightly nodular temporal artery on the left. She also reports several weeks of morning stiffness and aching across the shoulders and hips consistent with polymyalgia rheumatica, plus low-grade fevers and fatigue. There is no eye discharge, trauma, or preceding headache. Symptoms are most consistent with ischemic optic neuropathy secondary to giant cell arteritis, and she is concerned about further vision loss."
P0367,A 78-year-old man with hypertension and known COPD reports six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough that has recently limited walking across his home. Symptoms began after a mild upper‑respiratory illness and have evolved to intermittent pleuritic chest discomfort and increasing fatigue with an unintentional five‑pound weight loss. He is a former 40 pack‑year smoker. Examiner notes bibasilar inspiratory crackles and mild digital clubbing with trace bilateral ankle edema; he denies fever or significant sputum production. He recalls prior imaging showing emphysematous change. He is concerned about worsening fibrosis versus superimposed heart failure or occult malignancy and seeks further evaluation.
P0368,"A 94-year-old woman with known hypertension and chronic atrial fibrillation presents with acute-on-subacute neurologic change: family reports two weeks of progressive gait instability and intermittent falls, with sudden worsening over the past 24 hours marked by new left-sided weakness and slurred speech. She is more confused than baseline and intermittently drowsy; caregivers also note urinary frequency and low-grade fever for two days. There was one brief syncope episode after standing this morning. No recent head trauma. Examination at home revealed pale skin and a cool left hand compared with the right. The pattern is concerning for a right hemispheric ischemic event precipitated by dehydration and possible urinary tract infection contributing to delirium and orthostatic hypotension."
P0369,"A 78-year-old woman with longstanding hypertension and known interstitial lung disease presents with three weeks of progressive dyspnea that began after an upper respiratory infection. Initially a dry cough, she now produces scant yellow sputum and reports low-grade fevers and new pleuritic right-sided chest discomfort. Over the past five days she has developed orthopnea and increased lower extremity swelling, with markedly reduced exercise tolerance and two episodes of near-syncope on exertion. On review she notes worsening baseline resting breathlessness and audible wheeze at night. Family reports increased use of her portable oxygen. She denies focal neurologic deficits, abdominal pain, or urinary symptoms. This course is concerning for ILD exacerbation versus superimposed pneumonia with possible cardiopulmonary congestion."
P0370,"A 32-year-old female presents with progressive exertional dyspnea and sharp right-sided pleuritic chest pain that began 48 hours ago. Symptoms started as a mild nonproductive cough after a long transatlantic flight and have evolved to resting shortness of breath with intermittent palpitations and one episode of scant hemoptysis. She also notes new right calf swelling and tenderness for three days. Past history is notable for intermittent asthma managed with as-needed inhalers and current use of combined oral contraception. She denies fever, recent surgery, or known COVID-19 infection. No prior thromboembolic events. The temporal association with recent prolonged travel, calf findings, tachycardia, and pleuritic pain raises concern for pulmonary embolism secondary to deep venous thrombosis."
P0371,"A 48-year-old man presents with progressive right-sided hearing loss and episodic rotational vertigo over the past six months, with two weeks of worsening imbalance and daily high-pitched tinnitus. Hearing decline was insidious at first but acutely worse after a self-limited upper respiratory infection three weeks ago; vertigo episodes last minutes and are associated with nausea and difficulty walking. He reports intermittent occipital headaches and a recent episode of right facial numbness while bending. Past medical history notable for well-controlled hypertension. No otorrhea or fever. He is concerned about a possible vestibular schwannoma versus recurrent Meniere-like attacks; formal audiometry and MRI brain/head-neck are pending."
P0372,"A 36-year-old male reports three weeks of intermittent binocular diplopia and progressive bilateral ptosis, most pronounced by evening. Symptoms are fatigable — double vision worsens after sustained reading or driving and improves with brief rest — and he describes new neck weakness when lifting his head from a pillow. Over the past week he has had episodic nasal regurgitation and choking with thin liquids, raising concern for bulbar involvement. He denies ocular pain, headache, sensory loss, or limb paresthesias. Symptoms began shortly after a self-limited upper respiratory illness two weeks prior. He has a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis, is a nonheavy smoker, and notes no recent weight loss or fevers. He is concerned about a neuromuscular disorder given the fluctuating pattern."
P0373,"A 21-year-old male reports a 10-day history of progressively worsening left-sided throbbing headache that began after an upper respiratory/sinus infection. Head pain is constant now, worse with Valsalva and leaning forward, and is accompanied by photophobia, nausea with intermittent vomiting, and brief blurred-vision episodes. In the last 48 hours he developed intermittent right arm paresthesias and a sense of neck stiffness; he also notes low-grade fevers and one episode of transient confusion. He denies prior migraine history, recent head trauma, or illicit drug use. Sleep is fragmented by severe morning pain, and over-the-counter analgesics provide minimal relief. He sought evaluation due to increasing neurologic symptoms and concern for an intracranial complication."
P0374,
P0375,
P0376,"A 72-year-old woman presents with sudden, painless loss of vision in her right eye that began abruptly this morning. Over the prior week she noted intermittent transient dimming of the same eye lasting minutes and a new, dull temporal headache with scalp tenderness and jaw pain when chewing. She denies eye redness, discharge, or trauma. Medical history is notable for long-standing hypertension and intermittent palpitations concerning for atrial fibrillation. Outside ophthalmoscopy was reportedly abnormal, and she was referred urgently for concern for central retinal artery occlusion. Given the constellation of amaurosis fugax, temporal headache, and jaw claudication, clinicians are worried about giant cell arteritis as an etiology versus an embolic event. She feels anxious but has no focal limb weakness."
P0377,"A 57-year-old man presents with six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and reduced exercise tolerance, now limiting him to short walks. He describes intermittent pleuritic right-sided chest discomfort and a nonproductive cough that this week produced scant blood-tinged sputum. He notes mild orthopnea and new right calf swelling that he attributed to a prior recent right lower-extremity DVT two months ago. Symptoms are worse with climbing stairs and accompanied by daytime fatigue and occasional lightheadedness on exertion. He has a 40 pack-year smoking history and a background of well-controlled hypertension. No fever or infectious symptoms. He denies recent travel other than a long car trip prior to the calf swelling. He is concerned because symptoms have progressed despite rest."
P0378,
P0379,"A 26-year-old woman presents with five days of progressive shortness of breath that began after a mild upper respiratory infection. She now reports sharp, pleuritic right-sided chest pain that worsens with deep inspiration and a single episode of scant hemoptysis. She endorses subjective fevers, drenching night sweats, and new limitation of exercise tolerance—previously she was very active. Over the past 48 hours she noticed a dull ache and mild swelling in her right calf. She has a history of intermittent childhood asthma and intermittent wheeze on exam at home, and uses nicotine-containing vaping products. No recent immobilization other than a long car ride last week. She is seeking evaluation for possible complication given progressive dyspnea and focal chest pain."
P0380,"A 71-year-old female reports three months of progressive gait instability and declining short-term memory. She describes a broad-based, shuffling gait with frequent hesitations and two recent falls; family notes she repeats questions and has difficulty managing finances. Over the same period she developed new urinary urgency with occasional incontinence. A recent head CT from an outside facility reportedly shows ventriculomegaly. Past medical history is notable for hypertension and type 2 diabetes, with distal decreased vibration consistent with diabetic peripheral neuropathy that may worsen balance. Symptoms worsened after a minor trip last month but there is no fever or focal limb weakness. Clinical concern is for normal pressure hydrocephalus versus multifactorial gait impairment related to neuropathy and vascular disease."

P0383,
P0384,"An 85-year-old man presents with a three-week history of progressive exertional dyspnea and a dry cough that began after a mild upper respiratory illness. Over the past two nights he developed new palpitations and noticed the dyspnea at rest with orthopnea, requiring two pillows, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea awakening him once nightly. Family reports increasing fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance. On exam he has bilateral pitting leg edema and bibasilar crackles at the lung bases. He has a background of hypertension and coronary artery disease. He denies chest pain or fever. Symptoms suggest decompensated heart failure, possibly precipitated by new-onset atrial fibrillation with associated exertional hypoxemia and fluid retention."
P0385,"A 64-year-old man presents with a two-month history of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough that began after a brief upper respiratory illness. He now becomes short of breath with climbing a single flight of stairs and notes intermittent sharp pleuritic right-sided chest pain. Over the past three weeks he has had scant streaks of hemoptysis and an unintentional 10-pound weight loss accompanied by low-grade fevers. He is a former 40-pack-year smoker and has obstructive sleep apnea treated with nightly therapy; he also carries a history of hypertension. He denies recent travel or known sick contacts. Symptoms have steadily limited activity, prompting concern for an underlying chronic pulmonary process and need for prompt imaging."
P0386,"A 38-year-old male presents with ten days of progressive right-sided pleuritic chest pain and exertional dyspnea that began after a week of nasal congestion and sore throat. Pain is sharp, worsens with deep inspiration, and is accompanied by a dry cough and intermittent low-grade fevers. He notes new palpitations and brief lightheadedness when climbing stairs and a persistent reduction in exercise tolerance. Two weeks ago he had a long car trip and recalls transient swelling and tenderness of the right calf that resolved. He is a current smoker with no chronic lung disease. Symptoms cluster temporally, raising concern for a thromboembolic process versus postinfectious pleurisy; he seeks evaluation due to increasing shortness of breath and recurrent chest pain."
P0387,
P0388,"A 61-year-old male reports three weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea with a new sharp right-sided pleuritic chest pain that began acutely after a prolonged car ride. He has a productive cough with yellow sputum and intermittent low-grade fevers, and he notes unintentional weight loss and increasing fatigue. Past history is notable for hypertension and a prior provoked deep venous thrombosis. Over the past two days he developed swelling and aching in the right calf and more pronounced breathlessness with minimal exertion; he also experienced palpitations. At home he felt lightheaded and noticed worsening shortness of breath. On exam he describes focal right lower‑lung crackles and subjective hypoxemia. Symptoms are most concerning for pulmonary embolism with possible infarction or superimposed pneumonia."
P0389,A 56-year-old female reports progressive exertional dyspnea for ten days associated with new right-sided pleuritic chest pain and a persistent dry cough. Symptoms began about a week after a prolonged car trip; she developed mild unilateral calf swelling three days later and noted sudden worsening of breathlessness with minimal exertion. She had one episode of scant hemoptysis and intermittent low-grade fevers but denies sputum production or wheeze. She describes mild dependent ankle swelling and denies orthopnea. Past medical history is notable for well-controlled hypertension and a 20-pack-year remote smoking history. She is concerned about a clot given the recent travel and calf swelling; no prior pulmonary disease or recent hospitalization.
P0390,"A 94-year-old female presents with four days of progressively worsening dyspnea and a productive cough after a brief choking episode while eating. Family reports new low‑grade fevers and decreased appetite; at home she developed increased work of breathing and oxygen saturation in the mid‑80s on room air. Exam at bedside noted bibasilar crackles and coarse bronchial breath sounds. She has known moderate COPD and chronic systolic heart failure with prior paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and caregivers describe longstanding oropharyngeal dysphagia. The clinical picture is most consistent with aspiration-related infection and hypoxemic respiratory compromise superimposed on underlying cardiopulmonary disease; she denies chest pain or focal neurologic deficit but is notably more fatigued and less ambulatory than baseline."
P0391,"A 49-year-old woman presents with a three-month history of persistent dry cough and progressive exertional dyspnea that began after a prolonged viral bronchitis. Cough is daily, worse with talking and exercise, often accompanied by throat clearing and salty-tasting postnasal drainage; she also describes intermittent acid regurgitation. Over the last four weeks she has noted wheeze on exertion and an episodic high-pitched inspiratory noise with a sensation of throat tightness consistent with paradoxical vocal fold motion. She reports one episode of scant hemoptysis but denies fever or weight loss. Activity tolerance has declined; she uses inhalers intermittently with limited benefit. Past history includes seasonal allergic rhinitis and a ten-pack-year remote smoking history. She is otherwise well and has no known occupational exposures."
P0392,"A 41-year-old woman reports 10 days of progressively worse exertional dyspnea and sharp right-sided pleuritic chest pain, worse with deep inspiration. The pain began after a long-haul flight two weeks ago and is accompanied by a dry cough and two episodes of scant hemoptysis. She also noticed new right calf swelling and aching over the past week and has intermittent palpitations with mild lightheadedness on exertion. Past medical history significant for well-controlled hypertension and intermittent childhood asthma; she had a self-limited upper respiratory infection three weeks ago. No recent medication changes. Given the travel history, unilateral leg swelling, pleuritic pain and hemoptysis, there is concern for pulmonary embolism."
P0393,
P0394,"A 97-year-old woman with known COPD and hypertension presents with three days of progressive dyspnea and a productive cough. Family reports greenish sputum, subjective fevers and decreased appetite after a recent upper respiratory illness; she has required more frequent supplemental oxygen for increasing hypoxia. On arrival she is more lethargic than baseline with new confusion and reduced oral intake. Exam notable for diffuse expiratory wheeze and bibasilar crackles; caregivers describe mild peripheral edema but no chest pain. The picture is most consistent with an acute COPD exacerbation precipitated by community-acquired pneumonia with associated delirium and worsening oxygenation, prompting consideration of inpatient treatment and short-term respiratory support."
P0395,"A 75-year-old woman reports a four-month history of progressive gait instability and subtle short-term memory decline. She describes a slow, shuffling, broad-based (“magnetic”) gait with two recent falls over the past month and increasing urinary urgency that progressed to occasional incontinence after a treated urinary tract infection two months ago. Family notes worsening apathy and episodic difficulty initiating steps. She has known lumbar spinal stenosis with intermittent neurogenic claudication that she feels worsens walking tolerance, and a longstanding history of hypertension. No chest pain or focal weakness is reported. Symptoms are insidious rather than acute, and she denies fever or delirium. The pattern raises concern for a mobility-cognitive-urinary syndrome such as normal-pressure hydrocephalus versus multifactorial gait impairment from stenosis."
P0396,"A 6-year-old female is brought for three months of intermittent crampy periumbilical abdominal pain with increasing early satiety and several episodes of nonbloody loose stools. Parents note two postprandial vomiting episodes, progressive decrease in appetite, and slowing of weight and height gain compared with peers. She appears paler and more fatigued at school. Symptoms began after a viral upper respiratory illness but have persisted despite elimination of obvious triggers. History is notable for childhood atopic dermatitis and occasional mouth ulcers. No blood in stool, fevers, or urinary symptoms. Concern is for malabsorptive or inflammatory causes such as celiac disease or lactose intolerance, with possible iron-deficiency anemia contributing to lethargy, versus a functional abdominal pain disorder; outpatient GI evaluation and growth assessment are planned."
P0397,"A 39-year-old male presents with three weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and an intermittent productive cough that began after a presumed viral upper respiratory infection. The cough was initially dry but became green-tinged, with low-grade fevers and nightly wheeze. Over the past 48 hours he developed sharp right-sided pleuritic chest pain and scant hemoptysis. He also reports new swelling and aching in the right calf after a long car trip two weeks ago. He is a 10 pack-year former smoker and has no prior cardiopulmonary disease. He denies intravenous drug use or recent surgery. Symptoms limit his usual exercise and have not improved with OTC cold remedies."

P0401,A 1-year-old female presents with three days of progressive cough and poor feeding. Symptoms began with clear rhinorrhea and a low-grade fever after a household contact with known RSV; over 48 hours the cough became more frequent with audible expiratory wheeze and intermittent worse coughing with feeds. Parents report two small episodes of non-bloody vomiting after meals and noticeably decreased breast- and bottle-feeding. At home she has had increased work of breathing with visible subcostal retractions and mild nasal flaring but no sustained cyanosis. No prior wheeze or hospitalizations. Exam today is concerning for viral bronchiolitis with reactive wheeze and possible reflux-associated aspiration contributing to feeding intolerance.
P0402,
P0403,
P0404,"A 16-year-old female presents with three weeks of intermittent palpitations and near-syncope, most pronounced when standing or during the first minutes after exertion. Episodes are described as rapid, irregular heartbeats with associated lightheadedness, exertional dyspnea, and a sensation of chest tightness; symptoms improve when she lies down. She notes one episode of faint blurred vision but no true loss of consciousness. Symptoms began after a brief febrile viral illness and are now triggered by dehydration and prolonged standing at school. Past history notable for iron-deficiency anemia diagnosed last year and baseline anxiety, both managed conservatively. Home pulse recordings captured frequent premature ventricular contractions. No focal neurological deficits, cough, or fevers at present. She denies substance use."
P0405,
P0406,
P0407,"A 23-year-old male reports progressive blurry vision in the right eye for ten days, described as decreased acuity and difficulty distinguishing colors, particularly red. Symptoms began shortly after a self-limited febrile upper respiratory illness three weeks ago and are associated with aching pain on eye movement and intermittent photopsias. He notes profound fatigue and a new heat sensitivity: vision transiently worsens after hot showers. Over the past three days he has developed brief paresthesias in the left foot and occasional neck discomfort when bending forward. He denies trauma, eye discharge, or systemic rash. On exam elsewhere he felt mild proximal leg weakness. He is most concerned about an evolving optic neuropathy; prior history is unremarkable and there is no current medication use."
P0408,"A 29-year-old male presents with three days of pleuritic left-sided chest pain and progressive dyspnea on exertion. Pain is sharp, worse with deep inspiration, and began after a 10-hour flight six days ago; he also notes one episode of scant hemoptysis. He reports progressive tachycardia and mild fever but denies sputum production aside from prior rhinorrhea two weeks ago. He describes new swelling and tenderness of the left calf over the past four days. Past history is notable for exercise-induced asthma as a child and a remote ankle sprain; he denies bleeding disorders, recent surgery, or IV drug use. He smokes intermittently and attributes some anxiety to the shortness of breath."
P0409,"A 92-year-old man presents with an eight-week history of progressive gait instability and worsening cognition, initially noted as slowed steps and difficulty initiating transfers. Family reports increasing urinary urgency with two episodes of incontinence and two low-energy falls over the past month. One week ago he had a 15-minute episode of slurred speech with transient right facial droop and confusion that resolved. He has known atrial fibrillation, and anticoagulation has been limited because of fall risk. On review he is more forgetful and less conversational than baseline. Concern centers on possible normal-pressure hydrocephalus contributing to gait apraxia and incontinence, with a superimposed embolic transient ischemic attack given his paroxysmal deficits."
P0410,"A 58-year-old woman presents with six weeks of progressive proximal leg weakness and persistent aching in her shoulders and hips, now making it difficult to rise from a chair and climb stairs. Symptoms began after a mild upper respiratory illness and have been accompanied by intermittent low-grade fevers, unintentional 7-lb weight loss, and new difficulty swallowing solid foods. She recently noticed a violaceous rash on her upper eyelids and a scaly erythematous patch over the anterior chest. She reports mild exertional shortness of breath but no chest pain. Past medical history is notable only for well-controlled hypertension. She denies recent travel or new medications. Onset, symmetric proximal weakness, cutaneous findings, dysphagia, and respiratory symptoms raise concern for an inflammatory myopathy such as dermatomyositis with possible lung involvement."

P0414,"An 8-year-old girl presents with a three-week history of persistent dry cough that began after a febrile viral upper respiratory infection. The cough is paroxysmal, worse at night, and provoked by exercise; parents note decreased tolerance for running and intermittent audible wheeze on exertion. There was transient low-grade fever the first few days but no choking or emesis. She also reports occasional chest tightness during play. Past history includes atopic dermatitis and seasonal allergic rhinitis. Home exposure to household tobacco smoke is reported. School staff administered an inhaled bronchodilator once with brief improvement. Primary concerns are ongoing reactive airway symptoms versus post-infectious small-airways disease."
P0415,"An 86-year-old woman presents with ten days of progressive exertional dyspnea now occurring at rest, associated with two nights of orthopnea requiring two pillows and a dry cough. She describes new intermittent palpitations and lightheadedness beginning three days ago after treatment for a urinary tract infection; she also felt mildly febrile at home. Family notes increasing lower extremity swelling. On arrival she is hypoxic on room air and has an irregularly irregular tachycardia. Lung exam reveals bibasilar crackles without wheeze. She has no chest trauma, hemoptysis, or focal neurologic symptoms. Concern is for acute decompensated heart failure precipitated by new-onset atrial fibrillation versus infectious or thromboembolic pulmonary disease."
P0416,"A 2-year-old female presents with a six-week history of progressive postprandial regurgitation and intermittent non-bloody vomiting associated with increasing feeding refusal and poor weight gain. Parents describe frequent arching of the back and irritability with meals, worsening since introduction of thicker solids, and fewer wet diapers over the past several days. She has a history of atopic dermatitis with perioral eczema and occasional noisy swallowing but no fever or respiratory distress. On exam she appears thin for age with dry mucous membranes. Working impression centers on gastroesophageal reflux disease with possible eosinophilic esophagitis or food protein–induced intolerance; structural obstruction is considered less likely. Plan includes feeding modification, hydration support, and expedited referral for pediatric gastroenterology and endoscopic evaluation."
P0417,
P0418,"A 15-year-old male reports a two-week history of progressive morning headaches following a soccer collision three weeks ago that caused a brief loss of consciousness and was labeled a concussion. Pain is pressure-like and worse with bending, coughing, and Valsalva; he rates it 6–8/10. Symptoms include transient visual obscurations, intermittent horizontal diplopia, pulsatile tinnitus, persistent nausea with one episode of emesis, and mild posterior neck stiffness. He denies fever, photophobia beyond increased light sensitivity during headaches, or focal limb weakness, but teachers have noted brief inattentive spells. Primary care documented bilateral optic disc swelling on fundoscopic exam. No prior migraine history, no recent infections, and no medication use. Family history noncontributory."
P0419,"A 13-year-old male reports four days of progressive blurring in his right eye with aching retro-orbital pain that worsens on eye movement. He describes colors as faded and has difficulty focusing at school; his teacher noticed decreased reading performance and a possible central visual field defect. Symptoms began about two weeks after a febrile upper respiratory illness. He also has intermittent tingling in the fingertips of his left hand and occasional clumsiness with balance when running, along with increased fatigue limiting sports. There is no head trauma, vomiting, or known allergy exposure. Parents are most concerned about sudden vision loss; an inflammatory optic neuropathy such as optic neuritis is suspected and prompts urgent ophthalmology/neurology evaluation."
P0420,"An 89-year-old male reports a two-week history of progressive exertional dyspnea with new right-sided pleuritic chest pain. He notes an increase in productive cough with yellow sputum and intermittent low-grade fevers since he had a recent minor fall and remained largely sedentary. He has a background of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and says his baseline exercise tolerance is markedly reduced. On presentation he was mildly hypoxemic and more tachypneic than usual. The temporal cluster—immobilization followed by worsening dyspnea, pleuritic pain, and sputum production—raises concern for a subacute pulmonary embolism, possibly with superimposed bronchitic infection complicating his underlying COPD. He denies syncope or frank hemoptysis."
P0421,"A 39-year-old man reports three weeks of progressively worse exertional dyspnea and intermittent pleuritic right-sided chest pain. Symptoms began within days of a long transatlantic flight and an initial bronchitic upper respiratory illness; his cough became productive of yellow sputum and over the past week he has had occasional streaks of hemoptysis. He also notes low-grade fevers, night sweats, and an unintended seven-pound weight loss over the last month. He is a current smoker with roughly a 15 pack-year history. In the past five days he developed new right calf pain and swelling and has noticed palpitations with minimal exertion. He denies prior chronic lung disease or recent hospitalizations."
P0422,A 78-year-old man reports six months of progressive exertional dyspnea and a nonproductive cough that has accelerated over the past month. He now becomes breathless after walking one block and requires frequent rests; family notes an eight-pound unintentional weight loss. He denies fevers or purulent sputum. Past history includes well-controlled hypertension and remote shipyard work with possible asbestos exposure. He endorses chronic heartburn. Prior exam documented bibasilar “Velcro” crackles and new digital clubbing; ambulatory oximetry demonstrated significant desaturation with exertion. He has no orthopnea or peripheral edema. Clinical concern is for a fibrotic interstitial lung process as the primary cause of his declining exercise tolerance.
P0423,"A 99-year-old male reports progressive dyspnea and a productive cough for the past seven days, beginning after an evening choking episode while eating. He describes yellow sputum, low-grade fevers and increased work of breathing with exertion; family noted new mild confusion and decreased oral intake. Baseline oropharyngeal dysphagia after a remote left hemispheric stroke limits swallowing and he has chronic COPD and long-standing hypertension. At home he tolerated only minimal fluids and developed intermittent oxygen desaturation, prompting presentation. On exam he notes coarse crackles in the right lower lung and increased respiratory rate. Concern is for aspiration pneumonia with hypoxemia on background COPD exacerbation; no chest pain, hemoptysis, or peripheral edema reported."
P0424,"A 2-year-old male presents with three days of worsening cough and noisy breathing after a household upper respiratory infection. Symptoms began as clear rhinorrhea and low-grade fever, progressing to persistent daytime cough, intermittent wheeze, and increased work of breathing over 48 hours. At home he has had tachypnea with noticeable intercostal and subcostal retractions and has taken fewer bottles with one episode of nonbilious emesis. On exam he is irritable with scattered expiratory wheeze and mild crackles; oxygen saturations have been intermittently low on room air. Parents report a similar bronchiolitis hospitalization as an infant and a history of eczema. They deny choking events or rash changes. Concerns include viral bronchiolitis with reactive airways and mild dehydration."
P0425,"A 92-year-old female reports an eight-week history of progressive gait instability with three unwitnessed falls. Family notes increasing urinary urgency with daytime incontinence and subtle cognitive slowing—worse word finding and difficulty with multitasking. She describes brief episodes of slurred speech and transient right-hand clumsiness lasting minutes, and occasional lightheadedness on standing. She had a treated urinary tract infection two weeks ago. Past medical history significant for longstanding hypertension and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, with prior presyncopal episodes. At baseline she remains independent with limited ambulation. Concerns center on possible normal pressure hydrocephalus versus recurrent transient ischemic events or chronic small-vessel ischemic change as contributors to the triad of gait disturbance, dementia-like symptoms, and urinary dysfunction. Further outpatient evaluation planned."
P0426,"A 10-year-old male is brought for a 10-day history of progressive daily morning headache and intermittent non-bloody emesis, worse over the past 48 hours. Symptoms began after a febrile upper respiratory illness two weeks ago and have evolved to include intermittent blurred vision and brief diplopia, sensitivity to light, and increasing clumsiness with unsteady gait and two recent falls. Parents report new lethargy and decreased appetite but no loss of consciousness or seizure activity. On review, he has mild neck stiffness and occasional horizontal eye movements described as ""jittery"" by his parents. No prior neurologic problems, no recent head trauma, and vaccinations are up to date. Differential considerations include postinfectious cerebellitis versus intracranial process causing increased intracranial pressure."
P0427,"A 53-year-old female reports two weeks of progressively worsening exertional dyspnea and sharp right-sided pleuritic chest pain. Symptoms began shortly after a prolonged flight three weeks ago and are accompanied by a dry cough, intermittent wheeze, and low‑grade fevers with night sweats; she denies hemoptysis. She notes intermittent right calf swelling over the past month and a 6‑pound unintended weight loss. Exercise tolerance has declined from walking one mile to only a few blocks without breathlessness. She has a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism and is otherwise independent in activities of daily living. No recent upper respiratory infection is recalled. The overall picture is concerning for a thromboembolic event versus evolving focal pulmonary inflammatory process, prompting further diagnostic evaluation."
P0428,"A 59-year-old female presents with a 36-hour history of intermittent right-sided weakness and slurred speech that has evolved into persistent mild expressive aphasia. The deficits began as brief right arm clumsiness over three days and worsened following an episode of palpitations. She reports a prior event last month of transient monocular vision loss in the right eye lasting ten minutes. Past medical history notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia; she endorses intermittent palpitations concerning for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and is not anticoagulated. She denies recent head trauma or infection. Prior outpatient exam documented a left carotid bruit. The temporal clustering of transient visual loss, focal neurologic deficits, and palpitations raises concern for cardioembolic TIA versus evolving ischemic stroke."
P0429,"A 92-year-old female reports ten days of progressive loss of vision in the right eye, describing gradual darkening and blurred central vision with intermittent flashes and new floaters. Two weeks before visual change she developed a persistent, unilateral temporal headache with scalp tenderness and episodic jaw claudication that limits chewing. She notes low-grade fevers, fatigue, and new morning stiffness and aching in both shoulders, which she attributes to longstanding osteoarthritis but says feels different. She denies trauma, eye discharge, or prior recent ocular infection; she has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Family helped her seek care after she could no longer read and developed slight difficulty navigating steps on the affected side."
P0430,"A 22-year-old female reports two months of intermittent palpitations and progressive lightheadedness. Palpitations are rapid and occasionally irregular, most prominent within minutes of standing and during mild exertion, frequently accompanied by near-syncope and brief presyncopal episodes. She describes marked exercise intolerance, persistent fatigue affecting daily activities, and new heat intolerance with increased sweating. Episodes typically improve when she lies down. Symptoms began several weeks after a febrile viral illness she recalls as infectious mononucleosis. She has a history of generalized anxiety that she feels has worsened with these symptoms but denies chest pain, syncope with injury, focal neurologic deficits, or shortness of breath at rest. The clinical picture is suggestive of orthostatic tachycardia and autonomic dysfunction prompting further cardiovascular and autonomic evaluation."
P0431,"An 81-year-old woman reports two weeks of progressive central vision loss in the right eye with sudden further decline two days ago; she describes a new central scotoma and blurring rather than pain. Over the past week she developed a dull temporal headache, scalp tenderness when combing her hair, and intermittent jaw claudication with chewing. She also notes morning shoulder stiffness and stiffness rising from chairs consistent with polymyalgia rheumatica, plus low-grade fevers and malaise. Her primary care clinician documented a right relative afferent pupillary defect and ordered inflammatory markers, which were elevated. She has chronic hypertension controlled on therapy. Clinical picture is most consistent with giant cell arteritis with suspected arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, prompting urgent referral for treatment and definitive evaluation."
P0432,"A 90-year-old male presents with three weeks of progressive shortness of breath and a productive cough. Symptoms began after several episodes of choking with liquids; he has longstanding oropharyngeal dysphagia following a prior ischemic stroke and reports recurrent aspiration. Cough is worse at night and associated with low-grade fevers, decreased appetite, and a seven-pound weight loss. Over the past five days he notes increased resting dyspnea and requires intermittent supplemental oxygen at home. On exam he endorses clear sputum turning thicker, and caregivers describe noisy swallowing and drooling. On auscultation there are new bibasilar crackles and occasional wheeze. No chest pain or peripheral edema is reported. He remains alert but more fatigued with exertion."
P0433,"A 69-year-old female presents with two months of progressive exertional dyspnea and a chronic productive cough that has recently increased in volume and purulence. Over the past week she developed intermittent streaks of hemoptysis and audible wheeze, worse with exertion. Three weeks ago she had a self-limited upper respiratory illness after which symptoms failed to resolve. In the last five days she complains of sharp, pleuritic right-sided chest discomfort and new right calf swelling and tenderness, raising concern for deep venous thrombosis with possible pulmonary embolism. She is a former smoker with a remote 35–pack-year history, and the clinical picture suggests underlying COPD with superimposed bronchiectasis as contributors to recurrent sputum production and hemoptysis. No fevers, weight loss, or recent travel."
P0434,"A 61-year-old man presents with five days of progressive exertional dyspnea and new pleuritic right-sided chest pain. He describes scant hemoptysis and orthopnea compared with his baseline COPD-related shortness of breath; symptoms began after a week of limited ambulation following an ankle sprain. He notes new right calf swelling and tenderness and reports a 40 pack-year smoking history and long-standing hypertension. On review, he endorses palpitations and marked fatigue, and his partner observed more pronounced diaphoresis with minimal exertion. He denies fever or recent travel. The temporal pattern—immobilization then unilateral leg swelling followed by acute respiratory worsening—raises concern for venous thromboembolism with possible pulmonary embolism on a background of chronic obstructive lung disease."
P0435,"A 77-year-old male presents with a three-month history of progressive gait instability and cognitive slowing. He describes shuffling, small-stepped gait and several near-falls while turning; family reports worsening word-finding difficulty and apathy. Over the past month he developed urinary urgency with nocturia and one episode of urinary incontinence. He notes intermittent lightheadedness and presyncope on standing, with one brief syncopal spell this week. Outpatient head CT showed ventriculomegaly with mild periventricular white-matter change, raising concern for normal-pressure hydrocephalus versus chronic small-vessel ischemic disease. Past medical history notable for hypertension; no recent head trauma or new focal weakness. Symptoms have gradually limited his mobility and prompted today's evaluation."
P0436,
P0437,"A 10-year-old boy presents with two weeks of progressive proximal muscle weakness and a violaceous periorbital rash. Parents note he now needs his hands to push up from a chair, struggles to climb stairs, and has dropped his school backpack twice. The rash includes scaly papules over the knuckles and extensor forearms. Symptoms followed a febrile upper respiratory illness a week earlier and have been accompanied by low-grade fevers, pronounced morning fatigue, and intermittent dysphagia with occasional coughing on liquids. He has become less active and lost a few pounds. Exam findings and the pattern of weakness with heliotrope and Gottron-like lesions are concerning for an inflammatory myopathy such as juvenile dermatomyositis, with parents also noting a small tender subcutaneous nodule suggestive of early calcinosis."
P0438,"An 85-year-old woman presents with progressive dyspnea and increased sputum production over three weeks, acutely worse over the past five days after a choking episode while eating. She describes purulent, foul-smelling sputum and subjective fevers with decreased appetite; family notes new confusion and slower ambulation. She has a history of bronchiectasis and hypertension. On review, she reports orthopnea is absent but now becomes breathless at rest and with minimal exertion. At home she has noted lower baseline exercise tolerance and intermittent wheeze. Today she appears more hypoxemic than usual with increased respiratory rate and basilar crackles on exam, raising concern for aspiration pneumonia complicating chronic bronchiectasis; differential also includes an acute exacerbation or superimposed infection."
P0439,
P0440,
P0441,A 71-year-old female reports two weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea with a sudden increase in shortness of breath and new pleuritic right-sided chest pain over the past 48 hours. She notes a three-day history of mild cough with scant sputum and a painful swollen right calf after a long car trip two weeks prior. In clinic she is tachycardic and mildly hypoxemic on room air. Past medical history is notable for COPD and well-controlled hypertension. She denies fevers or hemoptysis but feels more fatigued and lightheaded with exertion. The temporal pattern and unilateral leg swelling raise concern for deep venous thrombosis with possible pulmonary embolism precipitating acute decompensation on chronic lung disease.
P0442,
P0443,"A 39-year-old woman presents with six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a dry cough that acutely worsened over the past 48 hours with new pleuritic right-sided chest pain and a single scant episode of hemoptysis. She describes intermittent wheeze and audible breathlessness climbing stairs, and notes one-sided calf swelling and tenderness for three days. Symptoms began after a self-limited upper respiratory infection and she has a history of mild childhood asthma. She is otherwise active, currently on combined oral contraception, and denies recent travel. She reports occasional lightheadedness with exertion and subjective oxygen desaturation at times. The clinical picture is concerning for thromboembolic disease with secondary pulmonary parenchymal irritation."
P0444,"A 48-year-old man presents with three weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and intermittent right-sided pleuritic chest pain that began after a prolonged car trip four weeks ago. Pain is sharp, worse with deep inspiration, and has been accompanied by small-volume hemoptysis and episodic palpitations and lightheadedness on exertion. He notes a week of mild unilateral calf aching and recent lower-extremity swelling. Chronic morning cough and exertional wheeze have persisted for years since a 20 pack-year smoking history. He has well-controlled hypertension. He reports loud snoring with daytime somnolence suggestive of sleep-disordered breathing. He denies fever, rhinorrhea, or weight loss. Symptoms raise concern for acute thromboembolic disease on a background of chronic airway disease."
P0445,"A 31-year-old female presents with three weeks of progressive neurologic symptoms beginning with subacute blurred vision in the left eye accompanied by pain with eye movement. One week after the visual symptoms she developed intermittent right-sided paresthesia involving arm and leg and a brief electric shock sensation down the spine when she flexes her neck. Over the past ten days she reports new mild gait instability, increased fatigue, and urinary urgency without dysuria. Symptoms began after a self-limited upper respiratory illness; she denies trauma, fever, or recent travel. On review, she notes occasional transient double vision and worse imbalance on uneven surfaces. No prior neurologic history; family history noncontributory. She seeks evaluation for progressive focal neurologic deficits."
P0446,"An 85-year-old woman presents with six months of progressive balance decline and recurrent falls described as brief episodes of her feet “sticking” to the floor. Family reports slow walking with short, shuffling steps and difficulty initiating gait; she now needs a walker indoors. She has noticed worsening short-term memory and slowed thinking, with episodes of urinary urgency and two occasions of urge incontinence. Symptoms began after a minor head bump last year but progressed gradually rather than acutely. Examination at home noted increased lower-extremity stiffness and brisk reflexes. Past medical history includes long-standing hypertension and mild osteoarthritis of the knees. No fever, limb numbness, or new focal vision loss. Family is concerned about increasing dependence and cognition."
P0447,"A 73-year-old female reports progressive gait instability for two months with two recent unwitnessed falls. She describes a slow, shuffling, magnetic-appearing gait with difficulty initiating steps and frequent near-falls when turning. Over the same interval family notes worsening short-term memory, slowed thinking and new apathy affecting medication management. She also endorses urinary urgency with occasional daytime incontinence. Noncontrast head CT performed in the ED last week demonstrated ventriculomegaly out of proportion to cortical atrophy. Past medical history notable for long-standing hypertension and knee osteoarthritis limiting exercise. She denies headache, focal weakness, sensory loss, fever, or recent infection. Symptoms are insidious and progressive, raising concern for a gait disorder such as normal-pressure hydrocephalus versus multifactorial mobility decline."
P0448,"A 53-year-old female presents with a three-month history of progressive epigastric pain and early satiety, now accompanied by intermittent postprandial vomiting and increasing difficulty swallowing solid foods. Pain is described as gnawing and worse with larger meals; she notes new nocturnal heartburn and occasional tarry stools. Over the same interval she has had unintentional weight loss of about 10–15 pounds and worsening fatigue consistent with iron-deficiency anemia. She denies fevers or overt hematemesis and has minimal alcohol intake. Prior conservative management for dyspepsia provided only transient relief. The constellation of obstructive symptoms, melena, weight loss, and anemia raises concern for gastric outlet obstruction or an underlying gastric neoplasm, and she seeks endoscopic evaluation."
P0449,"A 32-year-old man presents with abrupt right-sided pleuritic chest pain and worsening shortness of breath that began 24 hours ago. Pain is sharp, worse with deep inspiration, and limits his ability to climb stairs; he also notes palpitations and exertional dyspnea that are new. Two weeks of a persistent dry cough followed a viral upper respiratory illness, and he had a single episode of scant blood-tinged sputum yesterday. He reports intermittent wheeze with exertion and reduced exercise tolerance over the past month. He returned from a long-haul flight five days ago. Past history is notable only for mild childhood asthma; he denies chronic tobacco use. He has had low-grade fevers intermittently and is concerned about possible clot or pneumonia."
P0450,"A 60-year-old man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and known obstructive sleep apnea presents with ten days of progressive exertional dyspnea and increased productive cough. Two days ago he developed sudden left-sided pleuritic chest pain and scant hemoptysis, associated with palpitations and shortness of breath at rest. He returned from a prolonged car trip two weeks ago and notes new left calf swelling and tenderness since then. He denies fever but reports darker sputum and decreased exercise tolerance compared with baseline. Onset was gradual for cough but abrupt for chest pain and hemoptysis, raising concern for thromboembolic disease superimposed on COPD exacerbation with possible hypoxemia and tachyarrhythmia."
P0451,"A 59-year-old woman presents with ten days of progressive exertional dyspnea that began after a brief upper respiratory infection. She now reports persistent productive cough with green sputum, intermittent pleuritic right-sided chest pain, and low-grade fevers. Shortness of breath is worse with exertion and when lying flat; she notes one recent episode of waking breathless at night. Over the past week she developed new bilateral ankle swelling and mild fatigue. Past medical history notable for long-standing hypertension and a 40-pack-year smoking history (quit five years ago). No recent travel or immobilization. She denies hemoptysis but feels more breathless than with prior bronchitis episodes, prompting evaluation for possible pneumonia, heart failure exacerbation, or thromboembolic complication."
P0452,"A 19-year-old male presents with acute right-sided pleuritic chest pain and progressive shortness of breath that began abruptly four hours ago during pickup basketball after an episode of forceful coughing. Pain is sharp, worse with inspiration, and associated with a dry cough and a single episode of scant hemoptysis. He notes background intermittent wheeze with exertion treated with an albuterol inhaler and regular vaping of nicotine and cannabis. He describes being tall and thin with no prior hospitalizations. On self-exam he noticed right-sided crepitus under the clavicle overnight. Symptoms followed a week of nasal congestion and sore throat. He denies fever, recent travel, or trauma. Concerned for a spontaneous pneumothorax with right-sided decreased breath sounds and possible subcutaneous emphysema."
P0453,
P0454,
P0455,"A 96-year-old man presents with ten days of progressively worsening dyspnea and new pleuritic right-sided chest pain. Symptoms began after a recent urinary infection that limited his mobility; family noted right calf swelling and increased fatigue five days ago. He reports a dry cough, exertional oxygen desaturation now prompting supplemental oxygen at home, and a low-grade fevers with intermittent confusion. Past pulmonary history includes COPD; he also has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He denies significant sputum production or recent travel. Onset and progression suggest possible acute pulmonary embolism from a suspected deep venous thrombosis with superimposed acute hypoxemic respiratory failure on chronic lung disease; pneumonia and aspiration are considered in the differential."
P0456,"A 31-year-old man presents with a four-week history of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough that began after an upper respiratory illness. He reports intermittent scant hemoptysis over the past week and pleuritic right-sided chest pain with deep inspiration. He notes low‑grade fevers, drenching night sweats, and an unintended 6‑kg weight loss since symptoms started, with markedly reduced exercise tolerance and early fatigue climbing stairs. He is a current smoker with no known cardiopulmonary disease but was treated for presumed community-acquired pneumonia two months ago with transient improvement. There is no recent travel or known sick contacts. He is concerned the cough is worsening and seeks evaluation because of the bleeding and progressive shortness of breath."
P0457,"A 22-year-old man presents with four days of progressive left eye pain and blurred vision that began after an evening of extended contact lens wear. He notes increasing photophobia, a thick mucopurulent discharge, and mild periorbital swelling; the pain is sharp and wakes him at night. Symptoms followed a freshwater lake swim about one week earlier. On attempted self-cleaning his vision worsened rather than improved. He denies systemic fever or recent trauma. Urgent care documented marked conjunctival injection and a central corneal opacity with an epithelial defect concerning for contact lens–associated keratitis or corneal ulcer; given the water exposure and severe pain out of proportion to exam there is additional concern for Acanthamoeba infection. Past ocular history notable only for nightly soft contact lens use and seasonal allergic rhinitis."
P0458,"A 95-year-old female presents with a three-month history of progressive gait instability and cognitive slowing. Family describes a magnetic, short-stepped gait with two falls in the past month and increasing need for assistance with transfers. Over the same period she has developed new urinary urgency progressing to occasional incontinence. Caregiver notes subtle memory loss, slowed speech, and difficulty with executive tasks rather than focal weakness. She reports intermittent frontal headaches and worsening imbalance when turning. Past history is notable for well-controlled hypertension and chronic osteoarthritis limiting mobility at baseline. No fevers or sensory changes. She had a minor head bump two weeks ago without loss of consciousness. Symptoms have insidiously worsened, prompting evaluation for possible normal pressure hydrocephalus or other structural cause."
P0459,"A 29-year-old man presents with five days of progressive right periorbital pain and horizontal diplopia that began after a week of purulent nasal congestion consistent with sinusitis. Pain is constant, worse with eye movement, and accompanied by a throbbing frontal headache and low-grade fever. He reports eyelid droop and visible redness of the conjunctiva on the right; exam notes mild proptosis and limitation of adduction and upward gaze suggestive of ophthalmoplegia. Vision is subjectively blurred on the affected side. No recent trauma. Past history includes seasonal allergic rhinitis. Symptoms evolved rapidly over several days, raising concern for an infectious complication extending from the sinuses to the cavernous sinus or adjacent soft tissues, prompting urgent evaluation."
P0460,"An 81-year-old female presents with two weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent nonproductive cough, acutely worsened over the past 48 hours by new right-sided pleuritic chest pain and scant hemoptysis. She notes decreased exercise tolerance and orthopnea compared with baseline, and reports a long automobile trip three weeks ago. On exam she has mild right calf swelling and increased work of breathing; oxygen saturation falls with minimal exertion. Past history includes COPD and hypertension but no recent infections. The temporal clustering of calf swelling, pleuritic pain, exertional desaturation, and hemoptysis raises concern for a pulmonary embolic event with associated hypoxemia; alternative considerations include COPD exacerbation or pulmonary infarction."
P0461,
P0462,
P0463,"An 84-year-old male reports progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough over the past three months, with notable worsening after a chest infection three weeks ago. He now tires after walking a block and has occasional resting dyspnea; family noticed weight loss and decreased appetite. Exam previously documented bibasilar inspiratory ""velcro"" crackles and mild digital clubbing; ambulatory pulse oximetry shows desaturation to the mid-80s with exertion. Prior high-resolution CT described basal-predominant reticulation and traction bronchiectasis suggestive of fibrosing interstitial lung disease, most consistent with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Past history includes hypertension and chronic gastroesophageal reflux, the latter reportedly worse at night. He denies wheeze, hemoptysis, or recent tobacco use."
P0464,"A 95-year-old female reports five days of progressively worsening dyspnea and productive cough with low-grade fevers and chills. Symptoms began after an episode of choking on liquids; she notes persistent oropharyngeal dysphagia since a prior left hemispheric stroke. Cough is thick, yellowish and worse when supine, and she now requires more assistance with activities of daily living. Background includes COPD, chronic atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. On review she complains of fatigue and decreased appetite; family notes recent unintentional weight loss and increased confusion. At home she has intermittent episodes of breathlessness at rest and appears more tachypneic than baseline. Concern is for aspiration-related pneumonia with hypoxemia on home pulse oximetry and possible COPD exacerbation."

P0481,"A 48-year-old woman reports abrupt onset of right-sided neck pain and a severe occipital headache two days ago after a vigorous neck stretch during a yoga class. Within an hour she experienced transient right monocular vision loss for about ten minutes followed by left arm weakness and slurred speech that resolved over 20–30 minutes. Since then she has had persistent dull right neck pain, intermittent lightheadedness, and new right eyelid droop with a slightly smaller pupil. She denies fever, recent infections, or anticoagulant use. Past history is notable for migraine with visual aura. Given the temporal association with neck movement, transient focal neurologic deficits, ipsilateral ocular ischemia, and Horner-like signs, carotid artery dissection with transient ischemic events is suspected."
P0482,"A 46-year-old man reports three weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and sharp right-sided pleuritic chest pain, worse with deep inspiration and coughing. He describes a productive cough with occasional blood-tinged sputum, intermittent low-grade fevers, and an unintentional eight-pound weight loss accompanied by night sweats. Symptoms began insidiously after a long transcontinental flight six weeks ago; he notes decreased exercise tolerance and a single episode of mild calf soreness but denies persistent leg swelling. He has no known chronic lung disease and a remote 10–pack-year smoking history. Clinic chest radiograph demonstrated a right upper‑lobe opacity. The constellation raises concern for pulmonary embolism versus focal pneumonia or underlying malignancy, and further imaging and sputum studies were requested."

Notably caregivers observed visible gastric peristaltic waves across the upper abdomen and a firm, mobile 1–2 cm olive-shaped mass in the RUQ. Birth course included brief physiologic jaundice resolved by week two. No fever or bloody stools. Concern for hypertrophic pyloric stenosis with secondary dehydration and failure to thrive; plan for confirmatory ultrasound and fluid resuscitation."
P0488,"A 66-year-old man presents with acute right-sided weakness and slurred speech that began 36 hours ago and worsened over the first 12 hours. Initially he noted subtle right-hand clumsiness and numbness, now with a right facial droop and mild dysphagia when swallowing solids. He reports new intermittent palpitations over the past week and has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia; he is not anticoagulated. On exam he has decreased strength (3/5) in the right arm and leg with impaired coordination and an unsteady gait. No headache, fever, or chest pain. Carotid bruit was noted on bedside auscultation. Symptoms are most consistent with an embolic left hemispheric ischemic stroke, possibly related to paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or carotid disease."
P0489,"A 40-year-old woman reports sudden-onset, severe spinning vertigo beginning 48 hours ago, persistent and worse with head movement. Symptoms are accompanied by nausea with two episodes of emesis and marked gait instability requiring support to ambulate. She noticed horizontal nystagmus on self-observation and describes intermittent oscillopsia but denies hearing loss or tinnitus. There has been no slurred speech, focal limb weakness, or recent head trauma. She recalls a week-long upper respiratory infection about ten days before onset. Past medical history is notable for well-controlled hypertension and episodic migraine without aura. She is concerned this could represent vestibular neuritis versus a posterior circulation event given the abrupt course; she has not had fever, ear pain, or documented stroke previously."
P0490,"A 50-year-old male reports three weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea with a daily productive cough and recent pleuritic right-sided chest discomfort. Over the past five days he has had two small episodes of hemoptysis and notes persistent right calf tightness and swelling that began after a prolonged car trip two weeks ago. He describes intermittent wheeze at night and has known obstructive sleep apnea treated with airway therapy; he is a former 25–pack-year smoker who quit five years ago and has a history of hypertension. He denies fever or weight loss. The temporal cluster of travel-associated calf swelling, new hemoptysis, and worsening dyspnea raises concern for subacute pulmonary embolism versus an alternative pulmonary process."
P0491,"An 18-year-old female reports a three-week history of progressive daily morning headaches. Pain is diffuse and pressure-like, worse with coughing or bending, and associated with intermittent blurred vision and episodic pulsatile tinnitus. Over the last two days she has noticed binocular horizontal diplopia with lateral gaze and persistent mild nausea without vomiting. She denies fever, neck stiffness, or prior migraine history. She reports approximately 25-pound weight gain over the past six months. An outpatient eye exam last week reportedly showed bilateral optic disc swelling. No recent head trauma, sinus infection, or new medications. She is concerned about worsening vision given the combination of morning headache, visual obscurations, pulsatile tinnitus, and papilledema."
P0492,"An 81-year-old woman reports progressive right monocular visual blurring over the past week that progressed to a dense central vision loss this morning. Over the preceding two weeks she has experienced new-onset right temporal headache and focal scalp tenderness, with eating-related jaw claudication. She also describes marked morning shoulder stiffness consistent with polymyalgia symptoms and intermittent low-grade fevers. Her review is otherwise notable for a modest unintentional weight loss over several weeks. She has a history of long-standing hypertension. She denies recent trauma, ocular discharge, or marked photophobia. Symptoms evolved insidiously and she is anxious about possible permanent vision impairment, prompting urgent assessment."
P0493,
P0494,
P0495,"A 17-year-old male reports sudden onset of sharp, right-sided pleuritic chest pain and acute shortness of breath that began two hours ago while playing basketball. He describes the pain as localized, worse with inspiration, and associated with rapid breathing and lightheadedness. Over the past week he had a dry cough after a self-limited viral illness and notes intermittent exercise-induced wheeze in childhood. He uses e-cigarettes occasionally and is a tall, thin athlete. He denies fever, leg swelling, or significant trauma. He has mild right shoulder discomfort but no prior hospitalizations. Given the abrupt pleuritic pain, acute dyspnea, and risk factors, he is concerned for primary spontaneous pneumothorax, possibly related to an apical subpleural bleb, rather than infectious pneumonia."
P0496,"A 7-year-old girl presents with a five-day history of cough and progressive noisy breathing. Symptoms began with rhinorrhea and low-grade fever, then 48 hours ago she had a brief choking episode while eating and since has persistent cough, audible wheeze and intermittent inspiratory stridor. Parents report increased work of breathing and decreased activity; she has had poor oral intake but no vomiting. At school a trial of a bronchodilator produced partial relief of wheeze. On exam at home she appeared mildly tachypneic with asymmetric breath sounds and prolonged expiratory wheeze. Concern is for foreign body aspiration with secondary reactive airways disease versus viral bronchiolitis; no prior hospitalizations, history notable only for atopic dermatitis."
P0497,"A 44-year-old female reports a three-month history of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough that began after a self-limited upper respiratory illness. She now tires after short walks, notes intermittent pleuritic chest discomfort and low-grade fevers, and has lost roughly 3 kg unintentionally. She describes occasional lightheadedness on exertion and episodic fingertip color changes in cold consistent with Raynaud phenomenon. She denies smoking or known cardiac disease. Primary care noted bibasilar inspiratory crackles on auscultation and observed brief oxygen desaturation with ambulation. The presentation is concerning for a developing interstitial lung process, such as organizing pneumonia or connective tissue–related interstitial lung disease, and she has been referred for pulmonary function testing and high-resolution chest imaging."
P0498,
P0499,"A 64-year-old woman presents with three months of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough, with marked worsening over the past ten days after a mild upper respiratory illness. She describes new pleuritic chest discomfort on deep inspiration and increasing fatigue with a 4-kg unintentional weight loss. At home she notes oxygen saturation falls with walking. She has bibasilar “Velcro” crackles on prior exam and now mild digital clubbing noted by family. Past history includes well-controlled hypertension and a remote 30 pack-year smoking history, quit two decades ago. Clinically concerned for evolving interstitial lung disease/pulmonary fibrosis with secondary hypoxemia; denies fever, wheeze, or peripheral edema."
P0500,"A 93-year-old female reports sudden painless loss of vision in the right eye over the past 48 hours, preceded by ten days of new temporal aching and intermittent jaw tiredness when chewing. She notes associated scalp tenderness when combing her hair and two weeks of morning stiffness and proximal shoulder weakness limiting dressing. There have been brief episodes of horizontal diplopia over the last week but no eye redness, discharge, or trauma. She has a history of well-controlled hypertension and prior right cataract extraction two years ago. Family denies recent infections or falls. Symptoms are concerning for an ischemic optic process in the setting of suspected giant cell arteritis with secondary polymyalgic features."
P0501,
P0502,"A 68-year-old man presents with three weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and decreased exercise tolerance, now limiting him to short walks. He describes a productive cough with occasional scant hemoptysis and new right-sided pleuritic chest pain that began after a prolonged car trip two weeks ago. He reports intermittent low-grade fevers and an unintended eight-pound weight loss over the past month. Symptoms are worse with exertion and when supine at night. Past medical history notable for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and long-standing hypertension; former 40 pack-year smoker who quit ten years ago. He denies recent infectious exposures. Exam and imaging are pending, with clinical concern for pulmonary embolus versus postinfectious or malignant process given the hemoptysis and weight loss."
P0503,"A 35-year-old male reports progressive shortness of breath and sharp right-sided pleuritic chest pain for seven days, worse with inspiration and exertion. He notes a dry cough that began after a mild upper respiratory illness and two episodes of scant hemoptysis. Over the last 48 hours he developed intermittent palpitations and lightheadedness with walking. He describes new swelling and aching in the right calf since his return from a long-haul flight two weeks ago. He has subjective low-grade fevers and decreased exercise tolerance compared with baseline; history is notable only for mild childhood asthma. He is most concerned about a blood clot given the leg swelling and pleuritic pain and denies recent trauma."
P0504,"A 57-year-old woman presents with six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent productive cough that began after a viral upper respiratory infection. Initially she produced green sputum but over the past three days developed scant hemoptysis and new left-sided pleuritic chest pain. She notes a recent long car trip one week ago and new mild swelling and tenderness of the left calf. She is a former smoker with a 30–pack-year history. On exertion she becomes breathless and reports lightheadedness; at rest she has intermittent palpitations and low-grade fever. Exam was notable for tachycardia and decreased breath sounds with bibasilar crackles, and oxygen saturation falls with ambulation. Concern is raised for pulmonary embolism versus infectious bronchopneumonia with possible pulmonary infarction."
P0505,"A 69-year-old female presents with six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea, now occurring with minimal activity and occasionally at rest. Symptoms began after a presumed respiratory infection and have been accompanied by a dry cough, intermittent pleuritic right-sided chest pain, and two episodes of scant hemoptysis. She reports increasing fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, and new bilateral ankle swelling with mild exertional presyncope when climbing stairs. She has a remote provoked pulmonary embolism and longstanding hypertension and is a former smoker with a 20-pack-year history. She denies fevers or purulent sputum. Concern is for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension or right-sided heart strain from recurrent embolic disease versus COPD exacerbation; outpatient cardiopulmonary evaluation and imaging were requested."
P0506,"A 71-year-old woman reports six months of progressive exertional dyspnea and a dry cough, with marked worsening over the past three weeks. She notes decreased exercise tolerance — now short of breath after minimal exertion — intermittent low-grade fevers and an unintentional 6-pound weight loss. At home she and family have observed finger clubbing and persistent basilar crackles on recent clinic exam. She is a former 10–pack-year smoker who quit decades ago and denies hemoptysis or chest pain. Past history is notable for seropositive rheumatoid arthritis that has been clinically quiet for several years. The chronic cough, crackles, clubbing, prior connective-tissue disease, and subacute decline suggest possible interstitial lung disease, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or occult infection."
P0507,A 76-year-old man reports a two-week history of progressive dyspnea and a worsening productive cough after a recent upper respiratory illness. Sputum has darkened and he endorses intermittent low-grade fevers and fatigue; he now tires with minimal exertion and is short of breath at rest. He has a prior diagnosis of COPD and notes increased wheeze compared with baseline. On review he describes new orthopnea and mild bilateral pedal swelling that developed over several days. He denies chest pain but notes occasional lightheadedness when ambulating. Symptoms are worse overnight and he has used his rescue inhaler more frequently without relief. He is concerned about persistent hypoxia and reduced functional status.
P0508,"A 21-year-old male college student reports sudden onset left-sided pleuritic chest pain and acute shortness of breath that began two hours after a bout of forceful coughing. Pain is sharp, worse with inspiration, and accompanied by a persistent nonproductive cough and a sensation of chest tightness; he notes mild wheeze intermittently. On self-examination he felt lightheaded but has not had fever, hemoptysis, or recent trauma. He is tall and thin with no chronic medication use. At presentation he describes decreased breath sounds on the left and a subjective hyperresonant quality when tapping that side. Given the acute, post-cough presentation and exam findings, primary spontaneous pneumothorax is suspected and he requests evaluation for chest radiography and possible decompression."
P0509,"A 19-year-old male reports two weeks of progressive right-sided visual loss and intermittent paresthesia. Vision blurring began after a brief upper respiratory illness and evolved into sharp central scotoma with retro-orbital pain that worsens with eye movement. He also describes tingling in the right arm and leg, subtle gait unsteadiness when descending stairs, new urinary urgency, and profound fatigue; daily holocephalic headaches are noted but without fevers or photophobia. Symptoms have interfered with reading and classwork. Prior outpatient exam documented reduced visual acuity on the right and a relative afferent pupillary defect. Differential consideration includes optic neuritis with possible early demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis versus postinfectious inflammatory neuropathy. He denies recent head trauma or substance use."
P0510,"A 4-year-old male with three days of rhinorrhea now has a progressively barky cough and hoarseness, worst at night. The cough began after a runny nose and low-grade fever and intensifies with agitation; caregivers report intermittent inspiratory stridor and audible noisy breathing when upset. He has mild intercostal retractions and tachypneic episodes during coughing spells, with decreased oral intake and two nights of poor sleep. No vomiting or significant wheeze. Symptoms partially improve with cool-mist exposure at home. There is a recent illness in daycare. Past history notable only for mild eczema. Parents deny known asthma or prior hospitalizations. Concerned about worsening work of breathing and dehydration risk, they seek evaluation for possible viral croup."
P0511,"A 22-year-old male college athlete presents with two weeks of intermittent spinning vertigo and a persistent dull occipital headache after a head-on collision during soccer. Vertigo is brief, triggered by rolling in bed or looking up, and associated with nausea and intermittent tinnitus; he describes occasional visual blurring and brief diplopia when symptoms peak. The occipital pain is worse with neck rotation and Valsalva, raising concern for a cervicogenic component; he also notes mild light sensitivity and unsteady gait on uneven ground. He denied loss of consciousness but had transient disorientation after the impact. No history of migraines or anticoagulant use. Symptoms began within 48 hours of the collision and have fluctuated despite rest, prompting evaluation for post-concussive vestibular dysfunction versus benign paroxysmal positional vertigo."
P0512,"A 34-year-old female reports progressive shortness of breath for ten days, beginning after a self-limited upper respiratory infection. Dyspnea is worse with exertion and when lying flat, and is accompanied by a persistent nonproductive cough and intermittent pleuritic right-sided chest pain that increases with deep inspiration. She notes new wheeze on auscultation at home and mild palpitations with activity. Low-grade fever and decreased exercise tolerance have been present; she also describes a single episode of scant hemoptysis. She has a remote history of childhood asthma but has required no recent inhalers. No leg swelling until yesterday, when she noticed mild calf tightness after a long car trip. She is concerned about pneumonia versus pulmonary embolism and sought evaluation due to worsening symptoms."
P0513,"A 1-year-old male presents for persistent cough and noisy breathing that began five days ago after a brief choking episode while eating. Caregiver reports an initial vigorous cough with gagging, followed by progressive tachypnea, intermittent wheeze, and visible subcostal retractions. He has had low-grade fever and decreased oral intake since onset and two brief periods of duskiness noted at home with crying. Nighttime cough is worse and feeds often end in coughing. On auscultation at home the caregiver describes focal rattling and occasional high-pitched sounds. No prior wheezing history, immunizations up to date. Concern is for aspiration-related pneumonitis versus developing focal pneumonia or reactive airways inflammation, prompting evaluation for hypoxemia and possible chest imaging."
P0514,"A 44-year-old female presents with two days of progressive dyspnea and pleuritic right-sided chest pain after a 10-hour car trip. She notes sudden-onset shortness of breath at rest, worse with inspiration, accompanied by a dry cough and one episode of hemoptysis. She reports new swelling and aching in the right calf for three days. At triage she was tachycardic and mildly hypoxic on room air. She takes combined oral contraceptives and had a treated upper respiratory infection last week. She denies known malignancy or recent surgery and has no prior thrombotic events. She describes mild anxiety about the symptoms but had normal exercise tolerance until this week."
P0515,"A 15-year-old female reports two weeks of intermittent right-hand numbness and brief speech arrest occurring several times daily. Episodes last 30–90 seconds, begin with a metallic taste and flashing lights in the left visual field, and are sometimes followed by a throbbing unilateral headache with photophobia. Symptoms began after a self-limited upper respiratory infection and have increased in frequency over the past five days, often after poor sleep or stress. She notes mild persistent paresthesia between spells but no fever, syncope, or clear weakness. Past history includes a mild concussion last year. She describes new situational anxiety and fragmented sleep. Differential considerations include focal seizures versus complicated migraine; family history is noncontributory. She seeks evaluation for neurologic imaging and outpatient neurology follow-up."
P0516,"A 44-year-old man reports three months of progressive exertional dyspnea and a daily productive cough that began after a prolonged bronchitis episode. Sputum is yellow-green and he notes two small episodes of hemoptysis. He describes intermittent wheeze and occasional pleuritic right-sided chest discomfort with deep breaths or coughing. Over the same interval he has had low‑grade fevers, night sweats, and an unintended 7-pound weight loss, with markedly reduced exercise tolerance. He is a 20 pack‑year smoker and works as an auto mechanic with frequent dust and solvent exposure. Past respiratory history includes childhood pneumonia and recurrent sinus infections. He denies recent travel or sick contacts but is concerned symptoms are not resolving despite rest."
P0517,
P0518,
P0519,"An 8-year-old girl is brought for a 10-day history of progressive cough and shortness of breath that began after a mild upper respiratory infection. Parents describe frequent nocturnal cough, audible wheeze with exertion, and chest tightness when she runs at school; she has become fatigued and stopped soccer practice because of decreased exercise tolerance. There has been intermittent rhinorrhea and low-grade fever the first three days, without vomiting or hemoptysis. On exam at home they noted prolonged exhalation and occasional retractions at night. Past medical history is notable for eczema and seasonal allergic rhinitis. No recent travel or known pertussis exposure. Symptoms partially improve with quiet rest but worsen with activity and nighttime, prompting evaluation for asthma versus postinfectious reactive airways."
P0520,"A 39-year-old female presents with three weeks of intermittent right upper quadrant abdominal pain that has become more constant and more severe. The pain is colicky, typically precipitated by fatty meals, and radiates to the mid-back and right scapula. She reports associated nausea with two episodes of non-bloody emesis and intermittent subjective fevers with chills. Over the past week she developed dark urine and mild scleral icterus, accompanied by troublesome generalized pruritus. Appetite is decreased because of discomfort. She remembers several brief biliary-colic–type episodes after heavy meals over the past year. Past medical history notable only for obesity; she denies alcohol use or recent travel."
P0521,"A 22-year-old woman reports a four-day history of progressive right upper quadrant abdominal pain that began after a fatty meal and now radiates to the right scapula and mid-back. The pain is colicky with several intense spasms, accompanied by intermittent fevers and rigors, nausea with two episodes of nonbloody emesis, and anorexia. Over 48 hours she noticed dark urine, pale stools, and new generalized pruritus; family members have commented on yellowing of her eyes. She recalls two prior brief episodes of postprandial biliary-type pain last year but no surgeries. She denies recent travel, alcohol use, or unusual food exposures. Symptoms have limited oral intake and prompted this urgent evaluation for possible biliary obstruction or ascending cholangitis."
P0522,"A 64-year-old man reports six months of progressive exertional dyspnea and a dry cough, with marked worsening over the past six weeks that now limits him to short walks. He describes intermittent low-grade fevers and an unintentional 10-pound weight loss, and notes reduced exercise tolerance. Prior exam documented bibasilar inspiratory crackles and mild digital clubbing. He is a former 30-pack-year smoker and worked in construction with possible asbestos exposure. He has a history of hypertension. He denies hemoptysis, orthopnea, or recent travel. The temporal progression and clubbing raise concern for an interstitial lung process—idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis—with infectious exacerbation considered."
P0523,"A 97-year-old man reports progressive gait instability and cognitive slowing over the past six months, with acute worsening during the last two weeks after a presumed urinary tract infection treated at home. He describes a short-stepped, shuffling gait and frequent hesitancy when initiating steps, and has had two ground-level falls without head trauma. Family notes increased urinary urgency and new daytime incontinence alongside intermittent disorientation and word-finding difficulty. He also endorses lightheadedness on standing suggestive of orthostatic symptoms. Past history includes long-standing hypertension and chronic atrial fibrillation. Clinical concern is for normal-pressure hydrocephalus as an underlying cause of the triad, with superimposed delirium from infection and possible orthostatic contribution to recent falls."
P0524,"A 15-year-old girl presents with two weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and chest tightness that began abruptly during soccer tryouts. She describes a loud inspiratory noise and throat tightness with peak exertion and an expiratory wheeze and dry cough that can persist for 30–60 minutes after stopping. Symptoms are reliably triggered by cold air and strong odors and have reduced her exercise tolerance; she reports two nocturnal awakenings with coughing. There was a mild upper respiratory illness immediately before onset. Past history includes seasonal allergic rhinitis and childhood atopic dermatitis. Parents report occasional throat tightness without wheeze at school during stress. She denies fever, chest pain, or syncope. Examination and spirometry are pending."
P0525,"A 34-year-old woman presents with two weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and intermittent pleuritic right-sided chest pain. Pain is sharp, worse with deep inspiration, and accompanied by a dry cough with two episodes of scant hemoptysis. She reports recent palpitations and lightheadedness on standing but denies fever. Symptoms began about one week after a transatlantic flight and she has been on combined oral contraceptives for contraception for the past year. She also notes new swelling and mild tenderness of the right calf. Past history is notable only for seasonal allergic rhinitis. She has not experienced recent trauma or major illness. She is concerned symptoms are worsening with minimal exertion and requests evaluation for possible thromboembolic disease."
P0526,"A 14-year-old male reports a four-day history of recurrent severe headaches with prominent brainstem-type symptoms. Episodes began after a mild upper respiratory infection and consist of unilateral throbbing pain with a scintillating visual aura, brief transient right arm paresthesia, and intermittent diplopia. Headaches are accompanied by photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea with occasional nonbilious vomiting; individual events last 30–60 minutes and sometimes awaken him from sleep. He also notes several spells of vertigo and unsteady gait between headaches, worse with exertion. He has missed two days of school and is increasingly anxious about recurrence. He denies fever, neck stiffness, or recent head trauma. No prior migraine history, and family history is noncontributory."
P0527,A 40-year-old man reports six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent productive cough that began after a presumed viral upper respiratory infection. Sputum is yellowish with two brief episodes of scant hemoptysis; he also describes new right-sided pleuritic chest pain when taking deep breaths and an audible wheeze at night. Symptoms limit walking up a flight of stairs and have not responded to over-the-counter expectorants. He notes intermittent low-grade fevers and night sweats but no weight loss. Past medical history is notable for a treated pneumonia several years ago. He is an occasional smoker (about a ten pack-year lifetime history) and works in construction with intermittent dust exposure. No regular medications or known drug allergies.
P0528,
P0529,"A 14-year-old male presents with six weeks of progressive daily holocephalic headache and intermittent visual disturbances since a soccer-related concussion. Headaches are pressure-like, worse with bending and Valsalva, and associated with transient visual obscurations and brief scintillating scotomas; he also reports new pulsatile tinnitus and morning nausea with occasional emesis. Twice he experienced lightheadedness and near-syncope when arising quickly from sitting. Parents note increased somnolence and difficulty concentrating at school. Primary care documented bilateral optic disc blurring and referred for neurology; there has been no fever, neck stiffness, focal limb weakness, or seizure. Current impression centers on post-concussive headache with concern for intracranial hypertension and secondary visual compromise; orthostatic symptoms raise possible autonomic contribution. Further neuro-ophthalmologic evaluation is planned."
P0530,"A 74-year-old man reports a six-month history of progressive gait difficulty characterized by short, shuffling, magnetic steps and trouble initiating walking, with three recent falls. Family members note slowing of thought, short-term memory loss, and increased apathy over the same interval. He has developed new urinary urgency with occasional urge incontinence rather than nocturia alone. Past medical history is notable for well-controlled hypertension. He describes mild unsteadiness on turning and needs a cane for longer distances; there is no limb numbness or tremor. Symptoms evolved gradually and were not preceded by infection. Outside CT head reportedly demonstrated ventriculomegaly, and primary concern is possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus versus progressive neurodegenerative gait disorder."
P0531,"A 32-year-old man reports acute-onset shortness of breath and sharp right-sided pleuritic chest pain developing over 36 hours. Dyspnea is constant, worse with exertion, and associated with lightheadedness and a single small episode of hemoptysis. He describes progressive left calf swelling and tenderness since an ankle fracture required immobilization three weeks ago after a soccer injury. He notes a recent prolonged car trip and is a current smoker. He denies fever, cough before this event, or known bleeding disorders. At home he felt palpitations and mild near-syncope. The presentation is most concerning for pulmonary embolism from a left lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis given the temporal sequence of immobilization, localized calf findings, tachycardia, and exertional hypoxemia."
P0532,
P0533,"An 87-year-old woman reports ten days of progressive shortness of breath and a dry cough that acutely worsened over the last 48 hours. Symptoms began after a viral upper respiratory prodrome with mild rhinorrhea and now include new right-sided pleuritic chest discomfort and occasional scant hemoptysis. She also notes recent left calf swelling and increased exertional dyspnea that limits ambulation. Past history is notable for COPD and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; she admits to missing several doses of her anticoagulation last week. She has thicker, yellow-tinged sputum but no high fevers. Examination at home was limited; family is concerned for possible pulmonary embolism vs COPD exacerbation with superimposed infection, prompting evaluation in clinic."
P0534,"A 71-year-old female presents with sudden, painless loss of vision in the right eye for two days, preceded by three days of intermittent diplopia and transient visual obscurations. She also reports a three-week history of new, bandlike temporal headaches with tenderness over the scalp and jaw claudication when chewing, and progressive morning stiffness in both shoulders consistent with polymyalgia-type symptoms. She notes low-grade fevers and fatigue but denies trauma, photophobia, or nausea. Her medical history is notable only for long-standing hypertension. There has been no prior eye disease; family history is noncontributory. Examiner is concerned for ischemic optic neuropathy secondary to giant cell (temporal) arteritis and expedited evaluation and vascular imaging were requested."
P0535,"An 80-year-old man reports ten days of progressively worsening exertional dyspnea and increased cough producing yellow-green sputum. Over the past 48 hours he notes new orthopnea, waking with breathlessness requiring two pillows, and a single episode of near-syncope when climbing stairs. He describes intermittent pleuritic right-sided chest discomfort and audible wheeze at baseline. Family observed progressive ankle swelling and decreased exercise tolerance compared with his usual chronic obstructive pulmonary disease baseline; he has a remote history of hypertension. He denies chest pressure consistent with ischemia but is concerned about a possible infection or heart failure flare given low-grade chills and reduced oral intake. He has not recently started new medications or traveled."
P0536,
P0537,"An 8-year-old male presents with ten days of progressive morning headaches, nausea, and intermittent non‑bilious vomiting. Headaches are pressure‑like, worse on awakening and partially relieved by sitting up; over the past four days he developed unsteady gait with frequent tripping, described as clumsy by his parents. Mother reports two brief episodes of double vision and transient blurred vision when he looks to the right. Symptoms began after a mild febrile upper respiratory infection; he had low‑grade fever and decreased appetite early in the illness but is currently afebrile. At school teachers noted increased somnolence and decreased concentration. Parents also observed transient one‑sided eye crossing at home. No history of head trauma or witnessed seizures."
P0538,"A 71-year-old man presents with a two-week history of progressive right-sided visual blurring and two brief episodes of transient monocular vision loss described as a curtain coming down. He also reports a new, persistent throbbing temporal headache with overlying scalp tenderness and pain when chewing; jaw claudication began about one week after the headache onset. Over the past two months he has noticed morning stiffness and aching in his shoulders consistent with polymyalgia-type symptoms, accompanied by low-grade fevers and malaise. He experienced one episode of double vision while bending forward. He has a remote history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. No recent head trauma, focal weakness, or infectious prodrome are reported. He sought evaluation because vision symptoms have become more frequent."
P0539,"A 50-year-old man reports six weeks of progressive epigastric pain, described as gnawing and worse after meals, with early satiety and intermittent postprandial nausea. He notes an unintentional eight-pound weight loss and two weeks of dark, tarry stools. Over the past week he has had lightheadedness when standing and increasing fatigue; he appears paler than usual. He has a remote history of GERD and admits to recent frequent NSAID use for chronic back discomfort. He denies hematemesis but is concerned about ongoing bleeding. Examination and history raise concern for peptic ulcer disease with possible gastric outlet obstruction or underlying gastric malignancy leading to iron-deficiency anemia; he requests evaluation with endoscopy and testing for H. pylori."
P0540,"A 20-year-old male college student presents with a seven-day history of progressive exertional shortness of breath and pleuritic right-sided chest pain, worse with deep inspiration. He reports a brief episode of hemoptysis and a dry cough beginning three days after a prolonged 10-hour bus trip. He also notes new right calf swelling and tenderness that developed around the same time. He has felt intermittently febrile with palpitations but denies syncope. Past history is notable for a heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation identified incidentally last year; no recent surgery or hormonal therapy. He is a non-smoker, denies illicit drug use, and says symptoms now limit climbing stairs and participating in sports."
P0541,"A 65-year-old woman reports three weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and an increasingly productive cough. Symptoms began after a mild upper respiratory illness and now include yellow-green sputum, intermittent pleuritic chest discomfort, and marked decline in exercise tolerance. She has longstanding COPD and bronchiectasis and a remote pulmonary embolism; she also carries hypertension. She notes new dependent ankle swelling and more frequent nighttime breathlessness. In clinic she is mildly hypoxemic on room air with bibasilar crackles and diminished air entry at the bases. Concern is for an exacerbation of underlying bronchiectasis/COPD with possible superimposed infection and evolving right‑sided volume overload related to chronic pulmonary vascular disease. Further imaging and sputum studies are planned."
P0542,"A 3-year-old boy presents with four days of progressive left-sided ear pain and fever that began after a week of rhinorrhea and cough. Parents note constant tugging at the left ear, decreased oral intake, poor sleep and increased irritability. Overnight he developed purulent otorrhea and new postauricular erythema with focal tenderness; he also seemed mildly unsteady when walking today. There has been no vomiting, rash, or seizure activity. Brief exam by parents and at urgent care reportedly showed a bulging left tympanic membrane and reduced response to whispered words on that side. The constellation is most consistent with acute left otitis media with otorrhea and early mastoid inflammation following an antecedent viral upper respiratory infection."
P0543,"A 92-year-old man reports three months of progressive gait instability and slowed thinking, initially unsteady steps that have evolved into a wide-based, shuffling/magnetic gait and two recent falls. Family notes increasing short-term memory loss and apathy with difficulty initiating activities; he now requires a cane and help with transfers. He also has new urinary urgency and nocturia with one episode of daytime incontinence. Symptoms acutely worsened after a treated urinary tract infection last month but have not returned to baseline. Examination at home shows mild bradykinesia without focal limb weakness. A prior noncontrast head CT reportedly demonstrated ventriculomegaly without infarct. Past history notable only for controlled hypertension. No fever, chest pain, or new visual change."

P0545,"A 98-year-old female presents with two weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and new orthopnea, reporting two episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea that awakened her at night. She has a persistent dry cough that became minimally productive after a brief choking episode while eating a week ago and has since had low-grade fevers and increased fatigue. Family note decreased oral intake and recent mild confusion. On exam she demonstrates bibasilar crackles and pitting pedal edema; oxygen saturation on room air is low compared with baseline. Past history is notable for long-standing hypertension and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with remote tobacco exposure. Clinical concern centers on acute decompensated heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, possible aspiration pneumonia, and hypoxemia on a background of chronic cardiopulmonary disease."
P0546,
P0547,"A 26-year-old man reports five days of progressive right-sided pleuritic chest pain and exertional dyspnea. Symptoms began after a viral upper respiratory prodrome with rhinorrhea and low-grade fever; an initial dry cough became productive with occasional blood-tinged sputum over the past two days. He describes sharp inspiratory pain, reduced exercise tolerance, intermittent wheeze, and palpitations but denies calf swelling. He returned from an eight-hour bus trip after a weekend soccer tournament and is an occasional smoker with a history of mild intermittent asthma. On review he reports subjective fevers and night sweats. Given focal pleuritic pain, hemoptysis, tachycardia and recent immobilization, the differential emphasizes pulmonary embolism versus community-acquired pneumonia with reactive airways component."
P0548,"A 48-year-old man reports three weeks of recurrent spinning vertigo and progressive imbalance, initially episodic but now occurring several times daily. Episodes are typically provoked by turning in bed or looking upward, last 30–60 seconds, and are accompanied by nausea and sweating; he endorses two near-falls. Over the same interval he has noticed fluctuating left-sided hearing loss, aural fullness, and low-frequency tinnitus after a self-limited upper respiratory infection two weeks before onset. He denies focal weakness, diplopia, or syncope. Past medical history is notable for well-controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. No otorrhea or ear trauma. He is concerned about possible Meniere disease versus BPPV or postviral labyrinthitis and requests further evaluation."
P0549,"A 36-year-old man presents with progressive exertional shortness of breath for six days, now present at rest, associated with sharp pleuritic right-sided chest pain and two episodes of scant hemoptysis. Symptoms began after a weeklong work trip with prolonged travel; he notes new right calf swelling and aching three days after returning. He developed a productive cough with green sputum and low-grade fevers shortly thereafter, and reports intermittent wheeze and chest tightness consistent with his history of mild intermittent asthma. He feels palpitations and is more easily fatigued climbing stairs. He denies recent trauma, illicit drug use, or prior thromboembolism. The timeline suggests possible deep venous thrombosis complicated by pulmonary embolism, though superimposed bronchitic infection is also a consideration."
P0550,"A 24-year-old male presents with two days of progressive shortness of breath and sharp right-sided pleuritic chest pain. He describes an acute increase in dyspnea on exertion and several episodes of lightheadedness and palpitations; one small episode of hemoptysis yesterday. He also notes new swelling and aching in his right calf since returning from a prolonged 12-hour bus trip five days ago. He is an active smoker and had a mild upper respiratory infection about ten days ago that resolved. He denies fever, prior cardiopulmonary disease, recent surgery, or illicit IV drug use. Symptoms began abruptly and have limited his ability to walk across a block; he is worried about a blood clot or pulmonary embolism given the travel and calf swelling."
P0551,"A 16-year-old female reports two weeks of progressive exertional shortness of breath and new right-sided pleuritic chest pain that began after a viral upper respiratory infection. She describes a persistent dry cough, worsening exercise intolerance, and intermittent wheeze, previously episodic with her history of mild intermittent asthma. Symptoms intensified overnight with sharper, localized right chest pain and a sense of decreased air movement on that side. She denies fever, significant sputum production, or leg swelling but notes occasional lightheadedness on stair climbing. Her mother heard an audible wheeze and describes quieter breath sounds on the right. No prior hospitalizations. She is otherwise well appearing but limited by dyspnea on exertion, prompting concern for an evolving pulmonary complication."
P0552,"A 42-year-old man reports a two-week history of progressive dry cough and exertional dyspnea, noting new pleuritic right-sided chest pain and scant hemoptysis for the past 48 hours. Symptoms began after a prolonged upper respiratory illness three weeks ago but have not fully resolved; he describes intermittent wheeze and reduced exercise tolerance compared with baseline. He has a history of well-controlled hypertension and chronic gastroesophageal reflux, and smokes about half a pack daily for two decades. Over the last four days he developed right calf swelling and tenderness, which he relates to a long car trip two weeks ago. He denies fevers or night sweats. He is worried these findings may represent a pulmonary embolism versus worsening chronic airway disease."
P0553,"A 29-year-old woman reports five days of progressive blurring in the right eye with sharp pain aggravated by eye movement. Vision has declined from baseline to difficulty reading fine print; colors appear washed in the affected eye. She describes intermittent photophobia and a dull periorbital headache that worsens toward evening, and notes mild nausea with the headaches. One week before symptoms she had a brief viral upper respiratory illness with nasal congestion and low-grade fever that resolved. Over the last two days she developed intermittent numbness and tingling in the left hand without weakness. She denies trauma, double vision, or recent topical eye exposures. Onset was abrupt and symptoms are steadily worse, now interfering with work and driving, prompting urgent evaluation."
P0554,"A 30-year-old woman reports five days of progressive vision loss in her left eye, beginning as vague central blurring and now described as a persistent gray spot centrally. She endorses aching periorbital pain that worsens with eye movement and noticeable color desaturation—reds look muted—along with intermittent flashes of light. Symptoms began after a brief upper respiratory infection approximately two weeks ago. She also has a dull occipital headache and mild unsteadiness on stairs but denies fever, trauma, or sensory numbness. Past medical history is notable only for migraine. The visual disturbance is impairing reading and driving, prompting evaluation for an acute optic process."
P0555,"A 16-year-old male reports five days of progressive blurring of central vision in the right eye with sharp retro-orbital pain that worsens on eye movement. He describes colors appearing ""washed out"" on the affected side and notes difficulty reading small print; his parents observed the right pupil reacting less briskly. Symptoms began three days after a self-limited febrile upper respiratory illness and are accompanied by frontal headache and intermittent nausea but no fever currently. He also endorses episodic numbness and tingling of the left fingertips and feeling slightly unsteady when running. No eye discharge, trauma, or prior ocular problems. Family history is notable only for autoimmune thyroid disease. Optic neuritis is suspected; he was referred urgently for ophthalmology and neuroimaging."
P0556,
P0557,"A 15-year-old male reports three days of progressive blurred vision in his right eye, initially episodic but now persistent, with central gray smudging and noticeable desaturation of color when comparing eyes. He endorses mild periorbital pain that worsens with eye movement and intermittent photophobia; there has been no trauma. Symptoms began shortly after a week of nasal congestion and sore throat. He also notes two brief episodes of right-hand numbness and a single spell of unsteadiness yesterday. At home he and his parents observed that the right pupil seemed less reactive to light and he is having difficulty reading distant text. No prior ophthalmic history or fever. Concern is for acute optic neuropathy, most consistent with optic neuritis in the setting of recent viral prodrome."
P0558,"A 73-year-old man reports six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea with a persistent nonproductive cough. He notes insidious decline in exercise tolerance and now becomes short of breath with minimal exertion; symptoms acutely worsened after an upper respiratory infection two weeks ago. On exam he has basilar inspiratory crackles and new digital clubbing described by his outpatient clinician. He is a former 45-pack-year smoker and has longstanding seropositive rheumatoid arthritis treated conservatively. He denies pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis, or overt peripheral edema. The subacute course in the setting of RA and prior tobacco exposure raises concern for underlying interstitial lung disease with a possible inflammatory exacerbation and evolving hypoxemia."
P0559,"A 61-year-old female presents with three days of progressive dyspnea and sharp, pleuritic left-sided chest pain. She reports a single episode of light hemoptysis and subjective palpitations with worse exertional breathlessness compared with her usual baseline chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She has a history of hypertension and a remote deep venous thrombosis; she completed a long overnight car trip the week prior. At home she noted a rapid heart rate and increasing lightheadedness, and an urgent care pulse oximeter registered low saturation on room air. No fevers, calf pain, or focal neurologic symptoms. Given acute hypoxemia, pleuritic pain, prior DVT, and recent immobilization, she is being evaluated with concern for pulmonary embolism."
P0560,"A 43-year-old man reports a six-week history of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent productive cough, initially following a winter upper respiratory infection. Sputum is yellow with occasional blood streaks; he notes low-grade fevers, drenching night sweats and a 5-kg unintentional weight loss. Cough provokes sharp, pleuritic right-sided chest pain and intermittent wheeze; symptoms wake him at night and limit stair climbing. He has a 20-pack-year smoking history and works in masonry with chronic dust/silica exposure. He was treated twice as an outpatient for presumed bronchitis with only transient improvement. He denies orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, recent travel, known TB contact, or peripheral edema. Concerns are progressive infection, postinfectious bronchiectasis, or early occupational lung disease."
P0561,
P0562,"A 91-year-old female presents with two weeks of progressively worsening shortness of breath, acutely worse over the past three days. Symptoms began after a brief choking episode while eating, followed by productive yellow sputum and intermittent low-grade fevers. She now endorses pleuritic right-sided chest discomfort, orthopnea requiring two pillows, and resting hypoxemia with increased work of breathing. Caregivers note reduced appetite and one fall last week. On review she reports new mild bilateral ankle swelling and intermittent palpitations but denies chest pressure or syncope. Physical findings at home include persistent tachypnea and audible bibasilar crackles. The clinical picture is concerning for aspiration-related pneumonia with possible superimposed congestive failure and dehydration."
P0563,"A 68-year-old man presents with three months of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough, noting that he now becomes breathless walking one block and has had several episodes of lightheadedness with exertion. Symptoms intensified after a brief bronchitic illness six weeks ago. He reports a 10-pound unintentional weight loss and decreased exercise tolerance; denies fevers or hemoptysis. On review he describes mild bilateral ankle swelling overnight and uses two pillows for sleep, but no chest pain. He is a former 30 pack-year smoker with long-term occupational dust exposure.

He notes associated nausea and photophobia and intermittently hears a whooshing sound in both ears. Over the past two days he has experienced brief (15–30 minute) episodes of right-arm weakness and numbness and one episode of double vision; he denies loss of consciousness. He reports a low-grade fever and a self-limited sinus infection two weeks ago. No recent head trauma, neck stiffness, or illicit drug use. Symptoms are impairing work and prompt evaluation for a possible intracranial or postinfectious process is requested."
P0570,"A 31-year-old man reports abrupt onset of left-sided pleuritic chest pain and progressive shortness of breath over the past 24 hours. Pain sharp, worse with deep inspiration and coughing; he also noted a small amount of blood-streaked sputum this morning. He describes intermittent palpitations and lightheadedness but no fever. Three days prior he developed aching and swelling of the right calf after a 10-hour bus trip; he is a current smoker and admits occasional anabolic steroid use for bodybuilding. On review of systems he denies recent upper respiratory infection or trauma. Symptoms cluster temporally with recent prolonged travel and unilateral leg swelling, raising concern for pulmonary embolism from an evolving deep vein thrombosis."
P0571,"A 47-year-old man presents with six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and worsening fatigue. He now develops orthopnea, requiring two pillows, and brief paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea that awakens him once or twice per week. Bilateral ankle swelling has progressed from mild to obvious by evening, and he describes intermittent palpitations with occasional lightheadedness on standing but no syncope. Symptoms began after a self-limited viral respiratory illness. He denies chest pain, fever, or cough productive of sputum. Recent outpatient echocardiography documented a reduced ejection fraction with dilated left ventricle, felt to represent nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Past history is notable for treated hypertension; he does not use tobacco. Review of systems otherwise unremarkable."
P0572,"A 32-year-old man presents with two weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and new left-sided pleuritic chest pain. Symptoms began several days after a seven-hour flight and followed a brief upper respiratory illness; he now has a dry cough with two episodes of scant hemoptysis. He reports recent right calf swelling and aching that worsens when standing. On review he notes palpitations and lightheadedness with exertion but no syncope or fever. Past history includes mild childhood asthma and a remote tobacco history. He denies recent trauma, intravenous drug use, or anticoagulant therapy. The temporal pattern and unilateral leg symptoms raise concern for thromboembolic disease with possible pulmonary embolism."
P0573,"A 26-year-old woman reports four days of progressive shortness of breath and sharp right-sided pleuritic chest pain that began two days after a nine-hour airplane flight. Dyspnea is worse with exertion and deep inspiration and is accompanied by a dry cough and one episode of blood-tinged sputum. She also notes intermittent palpitations and subjective fevers. After the flight she developed right calf tightness and mild swelling. She uses combined oral contraceptives and has a history of mild childhood asthma and seasonal allergic rhinitis. She denies recent immobilization aside from the flight and does not smoke. Symptoms have gradually intensified, prompting evaluation for possible pulmonary embolism versus asthma-related bronchospasm."
P0574,"A 70-year-old woman presents with two weeks of progressively worse exertional dyspnea and fatigue, now limiting her walk to a few blocks. She reports new orthopnea requiring two pillows and one episode of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea; family noted gradual swelling of both ankles over the same interval. She has a persistent, dry cough but denies fever or sputum. Symptoms began after a recent upper respiratory illness and have been accompanied by occasional palpitations consistent with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Her past history is notable for long-standing hypertension and prior echocardiographic suggestion of diastolic dysfunction. She denies chest pain at rest but notes mild exertional chest tightness and a 5-pound weight gain over ten days, raising concern for congestive heart failure exacerbation."
P0575,"A 39-year-old woman reports six weeks of progressive epigastric pain and early satiety. The discomfort is dull and crampy, reliably worse 30–60 minutes after eating and notably provoked by fatty meals; she also describes new intolerance of fried foods. She has daily nausea and two episodes of non-bilious vomiting this month, with postprandial bloating and intermittent right upper‑quadrant fullness. Over the interval she has lost about 8 lb unintentionally because of reduced oral intake. She wakes at night with occasional heartburn but denies fever, jaundice, melena, or hematemesis. She recalls treatment for H. pylori in the past and says symptoms began after a brief viral illness, gradually limiting work and sleep."
P0576,"A 77-year-old man reports six months of progressively worsening exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough. He first noticed breathlessness climbing a flight of stairs and now becomes short of breath after walking one block, with symptomatic drops in oxygen saturation on exertion and occasional lightheadedness. He has lost about 5 kg unintentionally and feels more fatigued; he denies fevers, night sweats, or hemoptysis. Examination revealed bibasilar ""velcro"" inspiratory crackles, mild digital clubbing, and trace ankle edema. Pertinent history includes a remote 20 pack‑year smoking history, prior occupational silica exposure, and well-controlled hypertension. The time course and findings are most suggestive of a chronic interstitial lung process with associated exertional hypoxemia."
P0577,"An 80-year-old female presents with six months of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent nonproductive cough, with a notable stepwise worsening over the past three weeks. She reports new exertional desaturation requiring pauses on stairs and a 10-pound unintentional weight loss. She has long-standing seropositive rheumatoid arthritis and remote tobacco exposure. On exam she notes basilar inspiratory crackles and observed digital clubbing at the fingertips. No chest pain or fever. A recent chest radiograph reportedly showed bibasilar reticular markings; primary team is concerned for rheumatoid-associated interstitial lung disease with developing hypoxemia. She denies ankle edema or orthopnea. Functional decline has limited household ambulation and prompted referral for pulmonary evaluation."
P0578,"A 6-year-old female presents with a three-week history of worsening cough, described as paroxysmal episodes with occasional posttussive emesis and an intermittent inspiratory ""whoop."" Symptoms began after a febrile upper respiratory infection and have persisted despite symptomatic care. Parents report daily nocturnal coughing, exercise-related shortness of breath with audible expiratory wheeze, and mild intercostal retractions during spells; sleep is frequently disrupted. She has a background of atopic dermatitis and recurrent otitis media. There is a household contact with prolonged cough. She has no hemoptysis or cyanosis. Exam concerns include reactive airways disease versus pertussis, with secondary consideration of atypical chronic infection or underlying ciliary dysfunction given the pattern of recurrent infections."
P0579,"An 85-year-old woman presents with three weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough that began after a presumed viral bronchitis. She now becomes breathless climbing a single flight of stairs and notes intermittent low-grade fevers and a 6–7 pound unintentional weight loss. She reports new exertional desaturation with brief lightheadedness and mild orthopnea at night. Examination at home noted increased work of breathing and resting tachypnea; on clinic auscultation she has bilateral bibasilar inspiratory crackles and mild digital clubbing. Past history notable for remote breast cancer treated decades ago and a 20 pack-year smoking history, quit >30 years. She denies chest pain or hemoptysis but is concerned about progressive decline and decreased exercise tolerance."

She also reports urinary urgency with occasional stress and urge incontinence developing over the same period. Symptoms worsen in the evening and slightly improve after rest. Past medical history notable for well-controlled hypertension and osteoarthritis of the knees, which she says predates current problems but does not explain the new cognitive change. No focal weakness, headache, fever, or photophobia. She denies syncope but acknowledges increased anxiety about mobility."
P0605,"A 46-year-old man presents with five days of progressive exertional dyspnea and sharp left-sided pleuritic chest pain. He notes a recent 7-hour car trip two weeks ago and a mild COVID-19 infection three weeks earlier. Two days ago he developed scant hemoptysis and new left calf swelling and tenderness; he also reports intermittent palpitations and lightheadedness. Shortness of breath worsens with exertion and he felt his oxygen was low at rest. He is a current smoker with a 20 pack-year history and has treated hypertension. No history of heart failure or chronic lung disease. He denies fever, recent immobility other than the trip, or illicit drug use. Symptoms are concerning for venous thromboembolism with pulmonary involvement."
P0606,"A 93-year-old man reports a two-month history of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough that began after a self-limited bronchitic illness. He notes increasing fatigue, reduction in walking distance from a few blocks to a single room, and an unintentional 6-pound weight loss. He now becomes breathless at rest and occasionally awakens short of breath when climbing stairs. Exam elsewhere by family revealed new basilar inspiratory crackles; home pulse oximetry shows desaturation into the mid-80s with minimal exertion. A recent outpatient CT chest reportedly demonstrated subpleural reticulation with early honeycombing suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis. Past history notable for well-controlled hypertension and a 40 pack-year remote smoking history; no ongoing fevers or sputum production."
P0607,
P0608,"A 90-year-old man reports three days of progressive dyspnea and a productive cough that began after a brief choking episode while eating. Sputum is copious and foul-smelling with intermittent low-grade fevers and right-sided pleuritic chest discomfort. He notes increased work of breathing at rest and a drop in exertional tolerance from baseline COPD with chronic bronchitic features; he uses home oxygen intermittently and has required higher flow the last two nights. Past stroke left him with mild oropharyngeal dysphagia, and family describe decreased oral intake and lethargy. On arrival he is tachypneic with audible crackles over the right lower lung field and peripheral oxygen desaturation. Differential priorities include aspiration pneumonia with superimposed COPD exacerbation and focal consolidation."
P0609,
P0610,"A 98-year-old woman presents with six months of progressive gait instability and cognitive slowing, with abrupt worsening over the past two weeks after a treated urinary tract infection. Her family reports increasing short-term memory loss, apathy, and daytime somnolence; she now requires assistance for transfers and has had three low-energy falls at home. Gait is described as broad-based with difficulty initiating steps and a magnetic quality, and she has new urinary urgency with occasional incontinence. On exam at home she was slow to respond with reduced attention and mild postural instability but no focal limb weakness. The clinical picture suggests possible normal-pressure hydrocephalus exacerbated by intercurrent infection and deconditioning; primary concerns are fall risk, cognitive decline, and functional loss."
P0611,
P0612,
P0613,"An 88-year-old man presents with a six-month history of progressive gait instability and intermittent confusion. He and his daughter describe a broad-based, shuffling/magnetic gait with several near-falls and two more significant falls in the past month. Over the same interval he developed urinary urgency that recently progressed to occasional daytime incontinence. Family notes worsening short-term memory and slowed thinking, with episodes of overnight disorientation. He has a long-standing history of treated hypertension. He also reports brief lightheadedness on standing that preceded one fall. A non-contrast head CT performed several months ago demonstrated ventriculomegaly without acute hemorrhage. No prior neurosurgical procedures; no fevers, focal weakness, or chest pain. The constellation raised concern for normal-pressure hydrocephalus with contributory orthostatic symptoms."
P0614,"A 9-year-old boy presents with five days of progressive unsteady gait and multiple near-falls. Symptoms began abruptly with truncal instability and difficulty navigating stairs, now accompanied by intermittent projectile vomiting and daily holocranial headache. Parents report new slurred speech and brief episodes of horizontal nystagmus on attempted lateral gaze, but he remains awake and interactive without focal limb weakness or sensory change. Two weeks prior he had a diffuse vesicular rash consistent with varicella and low-grade fever that resolved. No recent head trauma, no known toxin exposures, and immunizations otherwise up to date. Examination at home shows worsening dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing and inability to tandem walk, prompting concern for postinfectious cerebellar dysfunction."
P0615,"A 65-year-old female presents with acute onset shortness of breath and sharp, pleuritic right-sided chest pain that began 48 hours ago and has progressively worsened with minimal exertion. She endorses a dry cough and intermittent lightheadedness but denies fever or bilateral leg symptoms. She notes new left calf swelling and tenderness starting about a week after a prolonged 10-hour car trip two weeks ago. At home she felt palpitations and describes resting tachycardia with episodes of oxygen desaturation. Past medical history is notable for hypertension and osteoarthritis. She reports decreased exercise tolerance compared with baseline and is worried the symptoms may relate to a blood clot given the unilateral leg swelling; she has no recent surgery or known clotting disorder."
P0616,
P0617,"A 74-year-old woman presents with acute, painless loss of vision in her right eye progressing over 48 hours, preceded for two weeks by intermittent transient visual obscurations and new floaters. She reports associated persistent temporal scalp tenderness and jaw claudication with chewing, and has noted morning stiffness of the shoulder and hip girdles for the past three weeks limiting dressing. She describes low-grade fevers and an unintentional three-pound weight loss over a month. Primary care initiated empiric high-dose steroids after palpating a tender, cord-like right temporal artery. Past medical history is notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She denies head trauma, focal limb weakness, or diplopia. No prior ocular surgery; home vision decline was previously attributed to cataracts."
P0618,"A 70-year-old woman presents with four months of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough that began after a winter upper respiratory illness. Initially short of breath only with stairs, she now becomes winded walking across a grocery aisle and notes increased fatigue and a 7-pound unintentional weight loss. Her primary care clinician documented new bibasilar inspiratory ""Velcro"" crackles and reported exertional oxygen desaturation; she denies fevers, hemoptysis, or orthopnea. She is a former 10–pack-year smoker who quit decades ago and has well-controlled hypertension. She also describes intermittent pleuritic chest discomfort and mild daytime anorexia. She has not been on supplemental oxygen and seeks evaluation for progressive symptoms and concern for interstitial lung disease."
P0619,
P0620,"A 91-year-old man presents with six months of progressive cognitive slowing and new gait instability. Family reports a gradually shuffling, magnetic gait with difficulty initiating steps and worsening short-term memory; he has had three ground-level falls in the past four weeks. Over the last month he developed urinary urgency that progressed to intermittent incontinence. Exam is notable for broad-based gait and mild frontal release signs at home. Past medical history includes hypertension and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, managed outpatient. Symptoms are most consistent with possible normal-pressure hydrocephalus versus mixed vascular cognitive impairment; the family denies preceding infection, acute focal weakness, or visual loss. They seek evaluation for mobility support and etiologic workup."
P0621,"A 5-year-old boy presents with four days of progressively worsening cough and audible wheeze, preceded by two days of clear rhinorrhea and low-grade fever. Parents describe paroxysmal nocturnal coughing, shortness of breath with play, and increased work of breathing with mild intercostal retractions. He has decreased oral intake and poor sleep. On exam at home he appeared pale and fatigued between coughing spells. No known aspiration or foreign-body event. Past history notable for intermittent viral-induced wheeze last winter and chronic atopic dermatitis. No known cardiac disease. Symptoms partially responded to humidified air at home but coughing and activity limitation have increased, prompting evaluation for bronchiolitis versus reactive airways exacerbation and assessment of oxygenation."
P0622,"A 44-year-old man presents with two months of intermittent exertional syncope and progressive exertional dyspnea. Episodes occur when climbing stairs or during heavy lifting, often preceded by several minutes of central chest tightness and palpitations; one episode required him to sit. He also reports daytime lightheadedness and occasional near-fainting after standing quickly. Denies orthopnea, fever, or focal weakness. On prior outpatient ECG he had frequent premature ventricular complexes and a noted harsh systolic murmur that increases with Valsalva. Past history significant for well-controlled hypertension. Family history remarkable for a father who died suddenly in his 50s. He attributes worsening to a recent increase in gym activity and is concerned about a structural cardiomyopathy."
P0623,
P0624,"A 13-year-old male presents with two weeks of progressive dizziness and unsteady gait after a febrile upper respiratory illness; parents note onset about six days after the infection. He now has daily morning headache that worsens with head movement, intermittent nausea with one emesis, and new slurred speech. Onset included transient double vision and horizontal oscillopsia; at home he has had two near-falls. Symptoms cluster around coordination and brainstem-cerebellar dysfunction rather than isolated vertigo. There is no history of trauma, seizures, or chronic neurologic disease. Exam at triage showed truncal ataxia, dysmetria on the right, and horizontal nystagmus. Concern is for postinfectious cerebellitis versus other inflammatory or structural posterior fossa processes."
P0625,"A 77-year-old male reports six months of progressively worsening exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough. He describes a two-week acceleration with shortness of breath with minimal activity, intermittent low-grade fevers, and an 8-kg unintentional weight loss. He now notices activity-related oxygen desaturation and marked fatigue limiting his walking tolerance. Prior exam documented bilateral basilar inspiratory ""velcro"" crackles and early digital clubbing. He is a former 30–pack-year smoker with known hypertension. He denies chest pain, wheeze, or hemoptysis. Recent high-resolution chest imaging was reported to show basilar reticular change concerning for a usual interstitial pneumonia pattern, and he presents for evaluation of suspected idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with progressive hypoxemia."
P0626,"A 28-year-old woman presents with acute progressive shortness of breath and sharp left-sided pleuritic chest pain for the past 48 hours. Pain is worse with inspiration and associated with a dry cough and intermittent palpitations; she reports subjective lightheadedness and a recent sense of tachycardia. She noticed new right calf swelling, tenderness, and mild erythema two days ago after a six-hour car ride, and she is currently taking combined oral contraceptives. Past history is significant only for mild intermittent asthma and seasonal allergic rhinitis. There is no fever, recent trauma, or illicit drug use. Given the temporal sequence—post‑travel calf symptoms followed by acute dyspnea and pleuritic pain—she is concerned about pulmonary embolism secondary to deep vein thrombosis."
P0627,"A 61-year-old female reports three weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and intermittent right-sided pleuritic chest pain that began after a prolonged period of immobility during travel several weeks ago. She describes a new, nonproductive cough with occasional scant hemoptysis and reports one week of increasing unilateral calf swelling and tenderness. Episodes of palpitations and lightheadedness occur with minimal exertion; she has noticed transient resting tachycardia at home. She denies fever or night sweats but feels more fatigued than usual and avoids stairs because of breathlessness. No prior history of venous thromboembolism. The temporal sequence—travel, leg symptoms, then acute respiratory complaints—raises concern for deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism and possible secondary hypoxemia."
P0628,"A 62-year-old woman presents with sudden-onset episodic right facial droop and right arm weakness with slurred speech that began 36 hours ago. Each episode has lasted 10–20 minutes and has occurred three times, with near-complete resolution between events. She also describes a brief painless left monocular visual loss lasting about five minutes. Her medical history is notable for hypertension and a recent episode of palpitations two weeks ago suggestive of atrial fibrillation. On exam a cervical bruit was auscultated and mild residual right-hand clumsiness persists. The pattern is most consistent with recurrent transient ischemic attacks, likely embolic from a cardiac source with possible carotid atherosclerotic disease; she denies headache, fever, or recent trauma."
P0629,"A 55-year-old woman reports six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a daily productive cough, initially clear sputum that developed intermittent blood-tinged streaks over the past ten days. Symptoms began after a presumed bronchitis; she now notes low-grade fevers, pleuritic right-sided chest discomfort with deep breaths, and an unintentional five-pound weight loss. She describes occasional wheeze and increased nighttime shortness of breath limiting stairs. Past history is notable for well-controlled hypertension and a remote unprovoked DVT for which she is not anticoagulated; she is a former 30 pack-year smoker who quit five years ago. No recent travel. Concerned symptoms could reflect postinfectious bronchiectasis, occult infection, or thromboembolic disease given prior DVT."
P0630,"A 28-year-old woman reports abrupt onset of left-sided pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath that began 36 hours ago. The pain is sharp, worse with deep inspiration and coughing, and associated with scant hemoptysis and intermittent palpitations. She describes progressive left calf swelling and tenderness starting two days before the chest symptoms after a prolonged transatlantic flight; she uses combined oral contraceptives and has no prior thrombotic events. She has low-grade fevers and decreased exercise tolerance but denies wheeze, prior asthma, or recent immobilization other than the flight. Symptoms began while walking and have not improved with rest. No recent surgery or pregnancy. Given the temporal sequence of calf pain then sudden dyspnea and pleuritic pain, she is concerned about pulmonary embolism related to deep venous thrombosis."
P0631,"A 32-year-old woman reports a 10-day history of progressive vision loss in her right eye, describing central blurring and a small persistent scotoma. Vision worsens with eye movement and she notes aching periocular pain; colors appear washed on the right. Symptoms began shortly after a self-limited upper respiratory infection. She also describes intermittent tingling in the right forearm and occasional heat-related worsening of visual symptoms when showering. At a brief exam she had reduced visual acuity on the right and a relative afferent pupillary defect. She denies trauma, headache, or jaw pain. Given the subacute monocular visual loss with pain and sensory symptoms, optic neuritis with concern for an underlying demyelinating process was discussed and neuro-ophthalmology referral arranged."
P0632,
P0633,"A 63-year-old female presents with four days of progressive exertional dyspnea and sharp right-sided pleuritic chest pain that increases with deep inspiration. Symptoms began after a prolonged car trip and have progressed from breathlessness climbing stairs to shortness of breath at rest; she also describes intermittent palpitations and a dry cough. She noticed new swelling and tenderness of the right calf yesterday. She reports a low-grade fever and mild diaphoresis but denies hemoptysis. Past medical history is notable only for well-controlled hypertension. Given the temporal pattern after immobilization, the constellation of pleuritic pain, tachyarrhythmic sensations, hypoxia-related dyspnea, and unilateral leg swelling raises concern for pulmonary embolism secondary to deep vein thrombosis."
P0634,"A 32-year-old female presents with ten days of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent nonproductive cough that began after an upper respiratory illness. The cough is worse at night and with deep inspiration; she developed a sharp pleuritic left-sided chest pain when taking deep breaths. She reports intermittent palpitations with exertion, low-grade fevers, and marked fatigue with decreased exercise tolerance compared with baseline. On exertion she now notices audible wheeze and chest tightness; she denies hemoptysis, syncope, or unilateral leg swelling. She has a history of childhood asthma, off inhalers for several years. Symptoms evolved after a week of rhinorrhea and sore throat and have not improved with rest, raising concern for persistent postinfectious bronchospasm."
P0635,
P0636,"A 71-year-old woman reports progressive exertional dyspnea and a dry cough for approximately six months, with a marked deterioration over the past three weeks. She now fatigues with walking a single block and notes resting breathlessness; family observed new fingertip clubbing. She describes increasing bibasilar crackle sensation (patient-reported) and several episodes of nocturnal cough without fever. Over the last two weeks she developed bilateral ankle swelling and mild orthostatic lightheadedness. She has a history of treated hypertension and remote tobacco exposure. She denies chest pain or hemoptysis. The timeline and clubbing raise concern for underlying interstitial lung disease with secondary pulmonary hypertension and early right-sided heart failure, and she reports intermittent mild resting oxygen desaturation at home."
P0637,A 39-year-old man reports two weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and sharp left-sided pleuritic chest pain that began acutely after a long flight. Symptoms started as a dry cough following a recent upper respiratory illness but have evolved to occasional small-volume hemoptysis and marked reduction in exercise tolerance. He notes new swelling and tenderness in the left calf and intermittent palpitations with exertion. He has low-grade fevers and orthopnea is denied. Past history is notable for intermittent childhood asthma but no chronic lung disease. He is a current smoker with no known clotting disorder. He is concerned about a possible pulmonary embolism given the travel and calf swelling.
P0638,
P0639,
P0640,"A 28-year-old man presents with sudden onset right-sided pleuritic chest pain and progressive shortness of breath that began while playing basketball this morning. Pain is sharp, worsens with deep inspiration, and accompanied by a dry cough and lightheadedness. He reports a two-week prodrome of upper respiratory symptoms with intermittent coughing but no fever. He is tall, thin, a current occasional smoker, and has had spontaneous transient chest tightness with exertion in the past. On arrival he notes neck fullness and a sensation of air under the skin. He denies trauma, hemoptysis, or recent travel. Symptoms are most consistent with a primary spontaneous pneumothorax with possible subcutaneous emphysema; tachycardia and diminished right-sided breath sounds were noted at triage."
P0641,"A 25-year-old man presents with sudden left-sided pleuritic chest pain and progressive shortness of breath that began overnight. He reports a five-day prodrome of dry cough and mild rhinorrhea, then developed an acute popping sensation after a bout of forceful coughing while playing soccer; the pain is sharp, worse with inspiration, and associated with dyspnea and lightheadedness. He is an occasional cigarette smoker. On self-exam he noticed crepitus in the left supraclavicular region and now describes reduced air entry on the left without fever. He denies trauma, hemoptysis, or prior lung disease. Symptoms worsen with exertion, prompting urgent evaluation for possible spontaneous pneumothorax."
P0642,"An 8-year-old girl presents with a two-week history of intermittent binocular diplopia and new blurred vision, most pronounced in the afternoons and at school. Parents report a drooping right eyelid that worsens with play and improves after rest, and occasional periorbital pain without nausea or vomiting. She has mild photophobia and daily frontal headaches that awaken her once or twice per week. Symptoms began about a week after a brief viral upper respiratory illness; there is no recent head trauma or fever now. Exam at school noted variable horizontal eye misalignment and reduced near reading tolerance, impacting homework. Past history includes seasonal allergic rhinitis and normal developmental milestones. No prior ocular surgery or known refractive error. Family denies seizures or facial weakness."
P0643,"A 59-year-old female reports progressive exertional dyspnea and a nonproductive dry cough over the past nine months, with marked worsening in the last four weeks such that she tires after short walks and needs frequent rest. She notes occasional exertional lightheadedness and mild night cough that she attributes to reflux. She has developed resting fingertip clubbing and describes increasing baseline fatigue and unintentional 6–8 lb weight loss. On exam she feels short of breath with minimal exertion and recalls a prior diagnosis of systemic sclerosis; she was recently told her pulmonary symptoms may represent fibrosis. She also has well-controlled hypertension. No fevers, hemoptysis, or new cardiac chest pain are reported."
P0644,"A 33-year-old man presents with four days of progressive exertional dyspnea and new left-sided pleuritic chest pain. The dyspnea is worse with minimal exertion and accompanied by a dry cough and two episodes of scant hemoptysis. He developed left calf swelling and aching 48 hours after a prolonged overnight bus trip and notes mild low-grade fevers and sweats. He has a remote history of childhood asthma but has not used inhalers in years. He smokes a pack a day and denies illicit drug use. No recent trauma or surgery. He is anxious about a possible blood clot given the calf swelling and worsening breathlessness, and reports intermittent palpitations."
P0645,"An 82-year-old man reports two weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and persistent dry cough that has limited his walking pace. He notes a recent 48-hour change with new pleuritic right-sided chest pain and scant hemoptysis after a brief period of reduced mobility following a minor fall. He now has low-grade fevers and generalized fatigue. At baseline he carries a diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis treated conservatively and is a former smoker. On brief exam he had bibasilar inspiratory crackles and the patient mentions new right calf swelling and mild discomfort. He denies frank orthopnea or chest pressure. Symptoms have steadily worsened, prompting evaluation for acute exacerbation, pulmonary embolism, or superimposed infection."
P0646,"A 65-year-old man reports six months of progressive gait unsteadiness with two ground-level falls in the past month. He describes a slow, short-stepped, broad-based (magnetic) gait and increasing difficulty initiating steps; family notes slowed thinking and recent short-term memory decline over the same interval. Urinary urgency with occasional urge incontinence began three months ago and has worsened, limiting outings. He endorses mild distal numbness and paresthesia in the feet consistent with longstanding diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Past medical history includes treated hypertension and type 2 diabetes, both reportedly stable. He denies limb weakness, fever, or recent head trauma. Examination at the clinic revealed frontal release signs and cautious ambulation; clinical concern is raised for a hydrocephalus-related syndrome such as normal-pressure hydrocephalus."
P0647,"An 80-year-old woman presents with two months of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough that has noticeably worsened during the past week after a bronchitic illness. She reports decreased exercise tolerance, early satiety from breathlessness, and unintentional 6-pound weight loss. On review she notes intermittent low-grade fevers and new resting breathlessness requiring frequent sitting; family observed finger clubbing. Exam at home revealed increased work of breathing and persistent wheeze previously attributed to a remote 30-pack-year smoking history; she also has long-standing controlled hypertension. She denies chest pain or frank hemoptysis. Symptoms began insidiously and have clustered around insidious interstitial symptoms with recent acute decline, prompting concern for progressive pulmonary fibrosis with superimposed infection or acute exacerbation."
P0648,"A 5-year-old boy presents with two days of progressively worse cough and noisy breathing. Symptoms began with clear rhinorrhea and a low-grade fever after daycare exposure; caregivers recall a brief choking episode on a small snack three nights ago. Since then he has had persistent inspiratory stridor and intermittent wheeze, louder on the right, with diminished oral intake and decreased activity. At home he appears more tachypneic with visible subcostal retractions and occasional gagging but no cyanosis. He has a prior history of intermittent reactive airways triggered by viruses and several past otitis media episodes. Caregivers are concerned for a retained airway foreign body versus a viral-driven reactive airway exacerbation given the temporal choking event and focal noisy breathing."
P0649,"A 33-year-old female reports three months of progressive upper gastrointestinal symptoms, beginning with intermittent heartburn and postprandial regurgitation and evolving over six weeks into progressive solid‑food dysphagia and intermittent odynophagia. She experienced a recent food impaction that she relieved by self-induced regurgitation and subsequently noted approximately 10 lb of unintentional weight loss and decreased appetite. A two‑week trial of a proton‑pump inhibitor provided minimal improvement. Primary care testing last month revealed iron‑deficiency anemia. She has lifelong eczema and seasonal allergic rhinitis. She denies NSAID overuse, hematemesis, or fevers. Concern is for an obstructing ring or peptic stricture versus eosinophilic esophagitis; endoscopic evaluation with biopsy has been scheduled."
P0650,"A 47-year-old man presents with two weeks of progressive exertional chest pressure and shortness of breath; the pressure is described as a tightness across the mid-chest that reliably occurs with climbing a single flight of stairs and eases with brief rest. Over the past five days he has developed palpitations and intermittent lightheadedness, once nearly fainting after exertion. He reports new ankle swelling and wakes once nightly with breathlessness, needing two pillows to sleep, and had a single episode last week of sudden severe dyspnea waking him from sleep. He denies cough, fever, or pleuritic pain. Past medical history is significant for treated hypertension and a 20-pack-year smoking history. No recent travel or known infectious exposure."
P0651,"A 34-year-old female reports four days of progressive exertional dyspnea and sharp right-sided pleuritic chest pain that increases with deep inspiration. She also has a dry cough, intermittent wheeze, and subjective low-grade fevers; she noticed mild palpitations and feels more short of breath when climbing stairs. Symptoms began several days after a long transatlantic flight and she has used a rescue inhaler with only partial relief. Past history is atopic asthma, otherwise healthy. She takes combined oral contraceptives and recalls a brief right calf ache after the flight but denies hemoptysis, syncope, or recent upper respiratory infection. She seeks evaluation because her exercise tolerance has declined and chest pain persists despite rest."
P0652,"An 89-year-old man presents with two weeks of progressive dyspnea, acutely worse over the past 48 hours, and a three-day productive cough with yellow sputum and low-grade fevers. He endorses new orthopnea and increased ankle swelling; family notes mild confusion and lethargy since the breathing worsened. Symptoms began after a recent dental extraction, and he reports a chronic history of COPD and hypertension. On exam he has audible wheeze and bibasilar crackles at the lung bases consistent with volume overload versus consolidation. Concern is for aspiration-related pneumonia precipitating COPD exacerbation and a decompensated heart failure component, with hypoxic delirium. He denies chest pain, hemoptysis, or recent travel."
P0653,
P0654,"A 28-year-old woman presents with three weeks of progressively worsening daily headache, described as diffuse pressure worse in the mornings and with Valsalva maneuvers, now accompanied by transient visual obscurations and intermittent horizontal diplopia. She reports new pulsatile tinnitus on the right, photophobia, and episodic nausea without emesis. She notes a recent 15-pound weight gain over six months and irregular menses. On exam she endorses blurred vision on waking and occasional lateral gaze difficulty. No history of migraine or recent head trauma. The constellation of progressive headache, optic disc swelling complaints, visual disturbances, and sixth-nerve–type diplopia raises concern for increased intracranial pressure, most consistent with suspected idiopathic intracranial hypertension, prompting urgent neuro-ophthalmology evaluation and neuroimaging."
P0655,
P0656,
P0657,"An 84-year-old male presents with two weeks of progressive dyspnea and a new productive cough following a viral upper respiratory illness. He reports greenish purulent sputum and intermittent low-grade fever for five days, with worsening shortness of breath on exertion and one episode of scant hemoptysis yesterday. Over the past 24 hours he developed pleuritic right-sided chest pain and marked fatigue, prompting evaluation. He has a history of COPD and hypertension and is a former smoker. On ambulatory exertion he notes oxygen levels fall and he becomes noticeably more breathless. Exam at home revealed increased wheeze and diminished breath sounds at the right base. Primary concerns are COPD exacerbation with superimposed pneumonia versus pulmonary embolism."
P0658,"An 82-year-old man presents with a two-week history of progressive decrease in urine output and increasing bilateral leg swelling. He has long-standing hypertension and known chronic kidney disease but reports a recent change with worsening nocturnal urinary hesitancy and straining consistent with prostatic obstruction. Over the last five days he notes worsening fatigue, mild anorexia, intermittent nausea, and new muscle weakness with occasional palpitations. Family members describe brief episodes of lethargy and subtle confusion. Exam findings at home include progressive peripheral pitting edema and shortness of breath when climbing stairs. He worries this represents acute-on-chronic kidney injury from urinary retention with resultant volume overload and possible hyperkalemia. No recent antibiotics or procedures; no chest pain or focal neurologic deficits. He seeks evaluation for catheterization and assessment of renal function."
P0659,
P0660,"A previously healthy 18-year-old male presents with abrupt onset of left-sided pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea that began during soccer practice two days ago. The pain is sharp, worse with inspiration and coughing, and associated with a persistent dry cough and mild palpitations on exertion. He reports decreased exercise tolerance and intermittent chest tightness but denies fever, hemoptysis, or syncope. He vapes daily and had a brief upper respiratory infection one week earlier. On exam he describes asymmetric respiratory effort and diminished breath sounds on the left; he has no prior lung disease. Concern is for primary spontaneous pneumothorax versus viral pleuritis or bleb-related collapse; chest radiograph is pending and urgent pulmonary follow-up arranged."
P0661,"A 52-year-old woman reports sudden, painless loss of vision in her right eye this morning following two weeks of progressively worsening right temporal headache and scalp tenderness when combing her hair. She describes intermittent jaw claudication with chewing and new, pronounced morning stiffness in the shoulders and hips for six weeks, limiting dressing. Over the past month she has had low-grade fevers, fatigue, and a three-pound unintentional weight loss. There is an associated patchy visual field deficit and blurring that preceded the complete loss. She has a history of well-controlled hypertension on oral therapy and denies recent trauma, eye discharge, or systemic rash. Symptoms evolved from dull temporal pain to acute visual decline, raising concern for an inflammatory vasculitic process affecting the optic circulation."
P0662,
P0663,"A 1-year-old male presents with an eight-hour history of intermittent, colicky abdominal pain and progressive non-bilious vomiting. Parents describe recurrent episodes of intense crying during which he draws his legs up, separated by periods of relative calm. He passed one red-tinged stool this morning and has developed watery diarrhea and markedly decreased oral intake. Over the past several hours he has had fewer wet diapers and appears unusually lethargic with low-grade fever. On brief home exam the caregiver palpated a firm, sausage-shaped mass in the right upper abdomen. There was a viral upper respiratory illness about one week ago. No prior gastrointestinal surgery or known chronic illness. The timeline and clustered symptoms raise concern for possible intussusception with dehydration."
P0664,"A 10-year-old boy presents with a three-week history of progressive morning headaches and recurrent projectile vomiting, most pronounced on arising and with bending forward. Parents report new intermittent horizontal diplopia and blurred vision, accompanied by increasing unsteadiness and a broad-based gait with frequent falls while running. He has had decreased appetite and an unintentional 4-pound weight loss over two weeks and appears more lethargic with declining attention at school. There is no fever, recent head trauma, or systemic illness reported. On brief clinic exam he demonstrates bilateral papilledema and mild dysmetria on heel-to-shin testing. Family denies prior neurologic problems; symptoms have intensified over the last week, prompting urgent further neuroimaging and neurology referral."
P0665,"A 68-year-old woman presents with six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough, described as worse over the past two weeks after a bronchitic upper respiratory illness. She reports new low-grade fevers, fatigue, and a three-kilogram unintentional weight loss. On exertion she becomes short of breath and notes episodes of lightheadedness; family noticed her fingers appear broader. She has remote 20 pack-year smoking and a long-standing history of rheumatoid arthritis. On exam she endorses reduced exercise tolerance; auscultation reveals fine bibasilar inspiratory crackles. She denies chest pain or frank hemoptysis. She is most concerned about worsening breathlessness interfering with daily activities and seeks evaluation for possible interstitial lung disease or postinfectious complication."
P0666,"An 88-year-old male presents with five days of progressive dyspnea and a productive cough that began after a choking episode while eating. Family reports the sputum is foul-smelling and he developed low‑grade fevers within 48 hours; over the past two days he has had new confusion and decreased oral intake. He carries a history of COPD and baseline reduced exercise tolerance. At home he has intermittent resting hypoxemia by pulse oximetry and appears more tachypneic than usual. Caregivers recall intermittent oropharyngeal dysphagia for months prior. The temporal clustering of choking, foul sputum, fever, hypoxemia and altered mental status is most consistent with aspiration pneumonia on a background of chronic lung disease."
P0667,"A frail 84-year-old man reports ten days of progressive exertional dyspnea and a productive cough after a recent influenza-like illness. He describes greenish sputum, intermittent low-grade fevers, and new pleuritic right-sided chest discomfort with deep breaths. He notes worsening orthopnea and has required nocturnal supplemental oxygen more often than his baseline from underlying COPD and long-standing hypertension. Family members report decreased appetite and reduced ambulation; he has intermittent wheeze and increased use of his rescue inhaler. He denies frank hemoptysis but notes mild bilateral ankle swelling compared with baseline. The constellation is most consistent with acute on chronic bronchitis or community-acquired pneumonia with possible early heart-failure exacerbation; he has a 40-pack-year smoking history."
P0668,"A 28-year-old woman reports a three-week progression of daily pressure-type headaches, worse on waking and with bending, accompanied by brief episodes of transient visual obscurations and intermittent binocular diplopia. She describes new constant pulsatile tinnitus on the right, morning nausea without emesis, and increased photophobia. Symptoms began after a 10–15 pound weight gain over two months and are exacerbated by Valsalva maneuvers. She denies fever, recent infection, or prior migraine history. An urgent exam noted bilateral optic disc swelling consistent with papilledema and a horizontal abduction deficit suggestive of a sixth-nerve palsy. No limb weakness or sensory changes; she is otherwise healthy and not taking new medications."

P0672,"A 68-year-old man reports three months of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough, with marked worsening over the past two weeks after a presumed upper respiratory infection. He notes new exertional desaturation—shortness of breath when climbing a single flight of stairs—and an unintentional 5-kg weight loss. Examination at clinic visit revealed bibasilar inspiratory crackles and early digital clubbing. He is a former smoker (20 pack‑years, quit 25 years ago) and has long-standing hypertension treated intermittently. He denies fevers, hemoptysis, or ankle swelling. The pattern, clubbing, and progressive hypoxemia raise concern for an underlying interstitial lung process such as pulmonary fibrosis with possible secondary pulmonary hypertension; further imaging and pulmonary function testing were requested."
P0673,
P0674,"A 2-year-old female presents with sudden onset intermittent severe abdominal pain and vomiting for 14 hours. Episodes occur every 20–30 minutes with loud crying and drawing up of the legs; between episodes she appears lethargic and pale. Parents report two episodes of dark red, “currant-jelly” stool and markedly decreased oral intake. She has low-grade fever and fewer wet diapers over the last 12 hours. On exam at home they palpated a firm, sausage-shaped mass in the right upper abdomen and noted signs of mild dehydration. Symptoms began after a mild runny nose and cough earlier in the week. Concern for intussusception with associated dehydration; transported for urgent evaluation."
P0675,"A 37-year-old female reports four months of secondary amenorrhea and new spontaneous milky nipple discharge, initially noted after stopping combined hormonal contraception. She also describes progressive, bifrontal headaches for three weeks with intermittent peripheral visual blurring and difficulty noticing objects on both temporal sides. Concurrent symptoms include persistent fatigue, decreased libido, and an unintentional 10-pound weight gain. She has been trying to conceive for a year without success. On review, she denies galactorrhea-related breast pain, fever, or focal weakness. The constellation of amenorrhea, galactorrhea, hyposexuality, headaches, and bitemporal visual changes raised concern for hyperprolactinemia from a pituitary macroadenoma; neuroimaging has been ordered and endocrine evaluation is underway."
P0676,"A 19-year-old male college student presents with four days of progressively worsening unsteadiness and slurred speech following a brief febrile viral illness. He developed myalgias and low-grade fever five days ago that resolved, then three days later noticed sudden gait instability with frequent veering and two near-falls. Family observed slurred words and intermittent horizontal double vision. He endorses nausea, a constant holocephalic headache, and oscillating blurred vision but denies headache photophobia or photophobia-associated vomiting. On exam he reports coarse head tremor and intermittent limb dysmetria when reaching; no clear limb weakness or sensory loss reported. He denies head trauma, recent travel, or substance use. Symptoms are progressive, impairing ambulation and concentration, and began shortly after the preceding viral syndrome."
P0677,
P0678,"A 31-year-old woman presents with six weeks of progressive postprandial epigastric burning and early satiety. Pain is worst after solid meals, rated 4–6/10, and is intermittently accompanied by nausea and nonbilious vomiting; she reports one episode of black, tarry stool last week. She has unintentionally lost about 6 pounds and notes increased fatigue and lightheadedness consistent with her known iron-deficiency anemia. She used over-the-counter NSAIDs nightly for a wrist strain over the past two months and had documented H. pylori infection treated in adolescence. The temporal pattern and combination of bleeding, weight loss, prior H. pylori, and recent NSAID exposure raise concern for peptic ulcer disease with possible partial gastric outlet obstruction; she denies alcohol or tobacco use."

P0681,"A 64-year-old woman presents with six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and three weeks of a productive cough with yellow sputum; she now tires after short walks and avoids stairs. She reports intermittent pleuritic right-sided chest discomfort and two episodes of scant hemoptysis over the past week. She notes persistent left calf swelling since an outpatient diagnosis of left lower-extremity DVT two months ago. Home history includes well-controlled hypertension and a 25 pack-year remote smoking history; she stopped ten years ago. She describes new exertional lightheadedness and occasional palpitations but denies fever, night sweats, or weight loss. The temporal clustering of prior DVT, progressive dyspnea, pleuritic pain, and edema raises concern for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension with a superimposed bronchitic process."
P0682,
P0683,"A 61-year-old female presents with eight weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough that began after a brief bronchitic illness. She notes intermittent pleuritic right-sided chest discomfort, low-grade fevers, and a 6–8 pound unintentional weight loss. Symptoms limit walking several blocks; she reports new oxygen desaturation with minimal exertion. Exam at the clinic revealed fine bibasilar inspiratory crackles and subtle digital clubbing. She is a former 20 pack-year smoker who quit a decade ago and has a history of well-controlled hypertension. No orthopnea or peripheral edema is reported. Given the subacute course, clubbing, and desaturation, concern is for an underlying interstitial lung process such as pulmonary fibrosis, with possible secondary pulmonary vascular involvement."
P0684,"A 38-year-old female reports six weeks of progressive palpitations, unintentional 11-pound weight loss, and marked heat intolerance. Palpitations occur daily, sometimes with lightheadedness and a fine tremor of the hands, and one episode lasted several hours with an irregularly irregular heartbeat. She describes worsening anxiety, insomnia, and recent menstrual irregularity with lighter, more frequent cycles. Over the past month she has developed eye irritation and apparent proptosis with periorbital swelling, and notes a new, diffusely enlarged, non-tender anterior neck mass that moves with swallowing. Symptoms began after a brief upper respiratory infection and have increasingly limited her exercise tolerance and work. She denies prior thyroid disease or known autoimmune disorders."
P0685,"A 70-year-old man reports six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough that began after a self-limited upper respiratory illness. Initially able to walk the dog, he now becomes breathless after a single flight of stairs and notes intermittent lightheadedness with exertion. He describes new mild bilateral ankle swelling and orthopnea at night. On review he endorses diminished exercise tolerance, a 40-pack-year smoking history, and a background of hypertension. Exam at home has revealed audible bibasilar crackles and occasional wheeze; he also noticed oxygen saturation dropping into the high 80s with minimal ambulation. Patient is concerned about underlying interstitial lung disease versus evolving pulmonary hypertension/right-sided strain and requests further evaluation."
P0686,
P0687,"A 9-year-old female presents with a two-week history of progressive dry cough and increasing shortness of breath during play that began after a febrile upper respiratory infection. Parents describe frequent nocturnal coughing spells and new chest tightness; she now tires easily in gym class and wheezes audibly with exertion. There has been no persistent high fever or hemoptysis. Past history is notable for atopic dermatitis and chronic seasonal allergic rhinitis. On brief clinic exam she showed scattered expiratory wheezes and mild tachypnea. Clinical concern is for new-onset asthma or viral-induced reactive airways disease, with post-infectious bronchiolitis considered given the prolonged cough and incomplete recovery since the initial infection."
P0688,"An 85-year-old woman presents with ten days of progressive vision loss in the right eye, beginning as blurred central vision and worsening to near-complete loss centrally. She reports a two-week history of a new, persistent right temporal headache and intermittent jaw claudication with chewing; over the past week she has noticed scalp tenderness when combing her hair. She describes new morning stiffness in both shoulders limiting dressing, consistent with polymyalgia rheumatica–type symptoms. She underwent cataract surgery in the left eye several years ago and has longstanding hypertension. She denies ocular trauma or purulent discharge but reports low-grade fevers and increased fatigue, and is worried the visual loss may be permanent."
P0689,"A 71-year-old man presents with two weeks of progressively worsening exertional dyspnea and a productive cough that began after a presumed upper respiratory infection. Sputum is thick and yellow, associated with intermittent pleuritic left-sided chest discomfort and audible wheeze at baseline; he reports using his rescue inhaler several times daily without relief. He notes increased orthopnea over the past three nights and mild bilateral ankle swelling, limiting his ability to climb stairs. Past history includes COPD with a 45 pack-year smoking history and well-controlled hypertension. He denies hemoptysis or weight loss but feels febrile with night sweats. Symptoms represent a change from his usual COPD course, prompting concern for superimposed bronchitic exacerbation or evolving cardiopulmonary decompensation."
P0690,"An 80-year-old female reports three months of progressive gait instability with a widened, shuffling step and two recent near-falls, accompanied by insidious short-term memory decline and word-finding difficulty. Family notes increasing urinary urgency and one episode of daytime incontinence over the past month. She describes a minor head bump on carpeted floor two weeks ago after which imbalance and intermittent headache worsened. No new focal weakness or sensory loss. Past medical history includes well-controlled hypertension and chronic knee osteoarthritis limiting endurance. Home uses a cane intermittently. Review of systems negative for fever, chest pain, or focal vision change. Symptoms concern for a chronic subdural process unmasking possible normal-pressure hydrocephalus versus progression of neurodegenerative disease."
P0691,"A 7-year-old girl presents with a two-week history of progressively worsening morning headaches and intermittent nonbilious vomiting. Caregiver notes headaches awaken her and improve as the day progresses; pain is pressure-like and accompanied by transient double vision and blurred vision.

She had a viral upper respiratory illness three weeks ago. On a recent school visit teachers noted increased somnolence and slower concentration. Outpatient exam reportedly documented papilledema and a left sixth-nerve palsy. Family denies seizures, rash, or recent travel."
P0692,"A 53-year-old female presents with three days of progressive exertional dyspnea and pleuritic right-sided chest pain. Symptoms began after a week-long domestic flight; she subsequently noted right calf swelling and sharp localized pain. She reports scant blood-tinged sputum and intermittent lightheadedness but no fever. Dyspnea is worse with minimal exertion and when supine. Past medical history notable for well-controlled hypertension and a 30-pack-year smoking history, quit five years ago, and ongoing menopausal estrogen therapy. She denies chronic cough or known lung disease. On review, she endorses tachycardia and anxiety related to breathing difficulty. The timeframe and calf swelling raise concern for deep venous thrombosis complicated by pulmonary embolism; alternative cardiopulmonary causes are under consideration."
P0693,
P0694,"A 64-year-old man reports six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough that began after an episode treated as bronchitis. Cough is now intermittently blood-tinged and is associated with reduced exercise tolerance; he becomes winded after climbing one flight of stairs. He also notes unintentional eight-pound weight loss, night sweats, and occasional low-grade fevers. He is a former 40–pack-year smoker and has a history of hypertension. He denies orthopnea or lower-extremity edema but notes increased work of breathing at night. On review he tried over-the-counter expectorants with minimal relief. Concern is for an underlying structural or inflammatory pulmonary process given bibasilar inspiratory crackles on self-observed exam and progressive systemic symptoms."
P0695,"A 35-year-old man reports four days of progressive blurred vision in his right eye accompanied by deep periorbital pain that worsens with eye movement. He describes color desaturation and a central dark spot that developed over 48 hours; exam demonstrated a relative afferent pupillary defect. Symptoms began about one week after a febrile upper respiratory illness. He also recalls two brief, self-limited episodes of right-sided numbness and tingling two months ago. He denies trauma, jaw claudication, or rash. The pattern of unilateral painful visual loss with dyschromatopsia and an RAPD is most consistent with acute optic neuritis and raises concern for an underlying demyelinating process."
P0696,"A 41-year-old woman presents with a two-week history of progressive right facial numbness and intermittent diplopia. Symptoms began several days after a self-limited upper respiratory illness and have evolved to include intermittent blurred vision, right-hand paresthesias, and mild dysarthria. She reports brief worsening of visual blurring and limb heaviness with heat and exertion, and over the past week developed gait unsteadiness on stairs and new urinary urgency without dysuria. She has episodic migraines in her past and a remote history of mononucleosis. She denies trauma, fever, or peripheral neuropathy risk factors. The constellation of focal sensory signs, ocular involvement, ataxia, and autonomic bladder symptoms raises concern for an inflammatory demyelinating process; outpatient MRI and neurology referral are planned."

P0698,"A 62-year-old woman presents with six weeks of progressively worsening exertional dyspnea and a dry, nonproductive cough. Symptoms began insidiously but intensified over the past two weeks; she now becomes short of breath after climbing a single flight of stairs. She reports intermittent low-grade fevers, decreased appetite with 6-lb unintentional weight loss, and mild fatigue. She has a remote 20 pack-year smoking history and a history of well-controlled hypertension. She also notes recent increased exposure to pet parrots in a household move. On review she denies chest pain or leg swelling. Exam at baseline shows bibasilar inspiratory crackles, early digital clubbing, and resting oxygen saturation of 91% on room air. Findings are concerning for an interstitial lung process, possibly hypersensitivity pneumonitis or evolving pulmonary fibrosis."
P0699,"A 57-year-old woman presents with progressive exertional dyspnea over six months, now limiting her ability to climb one flight of stairs, with a dry, nonproductive cough and recent acute worsening after a viral upper respiratory illness. She notes unintentional 8-lb weight loss and increasing fatigue. Exam findings reported by her PCP include bibasilar inspiratory crackles and new digital clubbing; she describes lightheadedness with exertion and intermittent palpitations but no chest pain or orthopnea. Past medical history is notable for seropositive rheumatoid arthritis treated previously with methotrexate and a remote 20-pack-year smoking history, quit 15 years ago. She denies hemoptysis; family history is noncontributory. She is concerned about worsening breathing and possible pulmonary fibrosis."
P0700,"A 91-year-old man presents with two months of progressive gait instability and frequent near-falls, now with two ground-level falls in the past three weeks. He describes short, shuffling steps and difficulty initiating walking, accompanied by new urinary urgency and daytime dribbling. Family notes subtle cognitive slowing and increased apathy over the same period. He also reports intermittent lightheadedness on standing and a transient episode of slurred speech last month. Past history is notable for long-standing hypertension and chronic atrial fibrillation, with prior imaging demonstrating chronic small-vessel ischemic changes. Examination today is limited by frailty but reveals broad-based, cautious gait and decreased lower-extremity vibratory sensation. Concern is for a multifactorial neurologic process—possible normal-pressure hydrocephalus versus vascular gait disorder with orthostatic component."
P0701,"A 90-year-old man presents with a three-month history of progressive gait instability and recurrent falls, now occurring twice weekly. He describes difficulty initiating steps and a heavy, shuffling or ""magnetic"" quality to his stride, requiring contact with furniture to ambulate. Family reports gradual slowing of thought and new word-finding difficulty over the same period, and he has developed daytime urinary urgency with one episode of incontinence. He also notes episodic lightheadedness when standing. Past medical history is notable for long-standing hypertension. There was no antecedent head trauma or infection. The constellation of gait disturbance, cognitive decline, and urinary symptoms raises concern for possible normal-pressure hydrocephalus versus mixed chronic cerebrovascular change; neurology referral and brain imaging have been requested."
P0702,"A 17-year-old female presents with a three-week history of intermittent lightheadedness and near-syncope, most pronounced on prolonged standing and walking between classes. She describes palpitations and an anxious tachycardia when upright, with one brief syncopal episode at home that resolved spontaneously. Symptoms are accompanied by daily headaches that are pressure-like rather than migrainous, intermittent blurred vision, and pervasive fatigue with poor concentration affecting school performance. She notes new exercise intolerance and occasional nausea but no fever or chest pain. The cluster began after a febrile viral upper respiratory illness four weeks ago. No prior neurologic disorder; menstrual history is regular. Symptoms improve rapidly when supine and are worse in warm environments and after prolonged standing."

Parents report two brief spells of right-hand clonic jerking with transient confusion and post-event lethargy, and since last week she has developed intermittent blurred vision and a subtle head tilt. They also note an unsteady, wide-based gait and occasional slurred speech at school. Symptoms began shortly after a self-limited upper respiratory infection; there is no history of head trauma or fever now. Past history is notable only for mild language delay. Between episodes caregivers have observed decreased use of the right hand. Concern is for a focal intracranial process—posterior fossa or cortical lesion—with associated focal seizures and raised intracranial pressure."
P0727,"A 21-year-old woman presents with five days of progressive blurred vision in her left eye accompanied by aching pain with eye movement and sensitivity to bright light. Vision was normal until she noticed central dimming and difficulty distinguishing reds while reading; the blurring has worsened intermittently, now limiting near tasks. She endorses brief flashes of light and reports a left relative afferent pupillary defect on self-testing at home. Two weeks prior she had a mild upper respiratory illness that resolved; she denies trauma, discharge, or fever. Over the past 48 hours she has had transient numbness and tingling in the right hand and occasional neck stiffness. No prior eye disease or systemic autoimmune diagnosis is known."
P0728,"A 71-year-old male reports three weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent nonproductive cough that began after a flu-like illness. He describes intermittent low-grade fevers, increasing fatigue, and an unintentional six-pound weight loss. A former 40 pack-year smoker with well-controlled hypertension, he notes occasional pleuritic chest discomfort and reduced exercise tolerance now limiting walking across the house. On self-observation he has resting shortness of breath; clinic pulse oximetry has shown mild hypoxemia. Examiners auscultate fine bilateral inspiratory crackles at the lung bases. The temporal pattern after viral illness with subacute cough, weight loss, crackles, and hypoxemia raises concern for organizing pneumonia or an exacerbation of underlying interstitial lung disease rather than simple bronchitis."
P0729,"A 95-year-old female presents with acute, painless central vision loss in the right eye that progressed over 48 hours. She reports two weeks of new-onset, persistent right-sided temporal headache and focal scalp tenderness, with intermittent jaw claudication when eating and low-grade fevers. Over the past month she has noted decreased appetite, fatigue and modest weight loss, and several weeks of morning shoulder and hip stiffness limiting dressing. She denies eye pain, diplopia, trauma, or discharge. Past medical history is notable for hypertension. Recent outpatient testing demonstrated elevated inflammatory markers. The constellation of sudden monocular visual loss with cranial symptoms and proximal stiffness is concerning for ischemic optic involvement from suspected giant cell arteritis."
P0730,"A 31-year-old female presents with progressive dyspnea and pleuritic right-sided chest pain for five days after a transcontinental flight ten days ago. She reports sudden onset shortness of breath with exertion that has progressed to resting dyspnea, associated with pleuritic pain worse with deep inspiration, intermittent hemoptysis and a dry cough. She notes new right calf swelling and cramping for three days and palpitations with lightheadedness. She takes combined oral contraceptives and has no smoking history. She endorses low-grade fever and decreased exercise tolerance. No prior thrombotic events. Symptoms began after recent prolonged travel and are concerning for deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism; she denies recent surgery or pregnancy."
P0731,
P0732,"A 20-year-old female college student reports four weeks of progressive lightheadedness, palpitations, and near-syncope triggered by standing. Symptoms began about one week after a self-limited viral gastroenteritis and are provoked by prolonged upright posture and after meals. She describes persistent fatigue, cognitive ""brain fog,"" intermittent tremulousness, and markedly reduced exercise tolerance. She also endorses nausea and early satiety with abdominal bloating, and has missed classes because of postural dizziness. On standing the heart races but she denies chest pain, focal weakness, or shortness of breath. No new medications or illicit drug use; past medical history notable only for seasonal allergic rhinitis. She reports prior brief orthostatic lightheadedness but this episode is more sustained and limiting."
P0733,"A 36-year-old man presents with six months of progressively worsening axial low back pain and stiffness. Pain is worst at night and on waking, improves with routine activity and stretching, and is minimally relieved by OTC NSAIDs. He reports morning stiffness lasting 45 minutes and intermittent right hip ache radiating to the groin. Over the past two months he has noticed decreased forward flexion and a sense of chest tightness with deep inspiration, limiting exercise tolerance. He has focal heel pain at the Achilles insertion consistent with enthesitis and intermittent fatigue. Last month he had an episode of unilateral eye pain, redness, and photophobia diagnosed as anterior uveitis. There is a family history of psoriasis. No fevers, urinary symptoms, or recent infections."
P0734,"A 44-year-old woman presents with two weeks of intermittent left-sided weakness and tingling, episodic diplopia, and unsteady gait. Symptoms began gradually after a session of vigorous neck stretching and were initially brief but have increased in frequency and duration, now lasting up to 20 minutes with residual fatigue. She also reports new occipital headache and posterior neck pain, worse with Valsalva and head rotation. There is subjective slurred speech during some episodes but no loss of consciousness. Past medical history includes well-controlled hypertension and occasional migraine without recent aura. She denies fever, chest pain, or recent infection. Given the posterior circulation symptoms—vertigo, ataxia, visual disturbance—and neck trauma history, she is concerned about vertebral artery dissection or recurrent transient ischemic attacks."
P0735,"A 68-year-old woman reports three months of progressive gait instability and slurred speech. She initially noted trouble with tandem walking and unsteady turns, now using a cane after two recent falls. Family describes worsening dysarthria and a coarse intention tremor of the right hand, with intermittent horizontal diplopia. She also endorses new urinary urgency and an unintentional eight-pound weight loss over eight weeks. Symptoms began subacutely after a brief respiratory illness. Past history notable for remote stage I breast carcinoma treated many years ago and osteopenia. She denies new medications. On review she notes increasing difficulty swallowing thin liquids and trouble with fine finger coordination, prompting concern for a central cerebellar process."
P0736,
P0737,"A 24-year-old male presents with severe right lower leg pain and progressive swelling that began about 36 hours after sustaining a closed tibial shaft fracture while playing soccer. Pain is constant, out of proportion to injury, and markedly worse with passive plantarflexion of the toes. On exam he has a tense anterior compartment with visible fullness, paresthesia over the dorsum of the foot, and weakness of ankle dorsiflexion producing an unsteady gait. Pedal pulses are palpable but reduced compared with the contralateral side; capillary refill is delayed. He reports inability to bear weight and increasing analgesic-resistant discomfort overnight. He denies fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain. No prior bleeding disorders or anticoagulant use."
P0738,
P0739,"A 50-year-old man presents with five days of progressive exertional dyspnea and new sharp right-sided pleuritic chest pain, accompanied by a dry cough and a single episode of scant hemoptysis. He recalls a prolonged car trip three weeks ago after which he noted aching and swelling of the right calf that has persisted. He also reports intermittent palpitations and lightheadedness when climbing stairs. His past medical history includes treated hypertension and a remote 20–pack-year smoking history. He denies fever or productive sputum but mentions mild night sweats and an unintentional six-pound weight loss over two months. He is concerned about a possible pulmonary embolus versus an atypical infection, and has had no prior thrombotic events."
P0740,"A 4-year-old female presents with a five-day history of persistent cough and intermittent noisy breathing after an episode of choking on a small food particle six days ago. Initially she had forceful coughing and transient gagging, then developed a harsher, worse cough that is nocturnal and associated with audible wheeze and occasional inspiratory stridor. Caregiver reports low-grade fever the first two days, decreased oral intake and activity, and one brief spell of pallor and cyanosis that resolved. On outpatient exam there was focal diminished breath sounds over the right mid-lung and a localized wheeze; pulse oximetry once read 93% on room air. No prior history of asthma or recurrent pneumonia; vaccinations up to date. Parents are concerned about possible retained aspiration."
P0741,"A 34-year-old man presents with four days of progressive blurred vision in the left eye, associated with aching pain that worsens on eye movement and intermittent flashes of light. He describes colors as “washed out” on the left and notes difficulty reading fine print; symptoms began a week after a self-limited upper respiratory illness. He also reports two brief episodes of numbness and tingling in the right hand over the past month and a recent sense of mild imbalance when turning quickly. On review he denies discharge, fever, or trauma. Prior ocular history is unremarkable. Exam in clinic revealed a relative afferent pupillary defect on the left and subtle optic disc edema. He is concerned about sudden visual loss and intermittent neurologic symptoms."
P0742,
P0743,"A 60-year-old male reports a three-month history of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough that began after a presumed viral bronchitis and has gradually limited his walking tolerance. He notes a 6-kg unintentional weight loss, intermittent low-grade fevers, and increasing fatigue; he denies hemoptysis but now experiences exertional desaturation and occasional night sweats. He is a former 20 pack-year smoker and spent decades in construction with possible asbestos exposure. Office exam revealed fine inspiratory ""velcro"" crackles at the bases and new digital clubbing. Past medical history is notable for well-controlled hypertension. He is worried symptoms represent an interstitial lung process such as pulmonary fibrosis and requests further evaluation."
P0744,"A 38-year-old woman presents with six weeks of progressive, daily holocephalic pressure and throbbing headaches, accompanied by transient visual obscurations and intermittent blurred vision. Headaches are worse on awakening and with Valsalva, and she reports new pulsatile tinnitus and photophobia but no fevers or focal weakness. She notes 20-pound weight gain over four months and irregular menses. Ophthalmologic exam by her primary provider reportedly showed optic disc swelling. She has nausea and occasional vomiting with severe flares. Past history significant only for childhood migraine; no recent infections or head trauma. She is a nonsmoker and denies alcohol use. Concern is for raised intracranial pressure—idiopathic intracranial hypertension versus secondary intracranial process—requiring neuroimaging and ophthalmology evaluation."
P0745,"A 28-year-old man presents with sudden-onset right-sided pleuritic chest pain and progressive dyspnea that began about 12 hours ago after heavy lifting at the gym. The sharp pain worsens with deep inspiration and is accompanied by a dry cough and intermittent lightheadedness; he reports palpitations and mild resting shortness of breath. He is a current cigarette and occasional cannabis smoker and describes a tall, thin body habitus. He denies fever, hemoptysis, leg swelling, or recent long travel. At home he noticed decreased air entry on the right and subtle neck crepitus. He has no chronic lung disease and seeks evaluation for suspected spontaneous pneumothorax given acute unilateral findings, tachycardia, and concern for mild hypoxemia."
P0746,"A 30-year-old woman presents with three weeks of progressive postprandial fullness, early satiety, and intermittent non‑bilious vomiting. The symptoms began about two weeks after a self‑limited viral gastroenteritis and are now accompanied by dull epigastric pain, upper abdominal bloating, and frequent heartburn. She reports persistent nausea with most meals and an unintentional 6‑kg weight loss from reduced intake. Bowel movements remain regular without melena or hematochezia, and she denies fevers or night sweats. She notes episodic lightheadedness when meals are delayed and increased fatigue. No history of peptic ulcer disease or diabetes. She has tried over‑the‑counter antacids with minimal relief and is concerned about possible delayed gastric emptying versus peptic pathology."
P0747,"A 16-year-old female presents with recurrent, severe left-sided throbbing headaches for one week, associated with transient visual scotomas and intermittent right arm weakness. Each episode begins with scintillating visual aura lasting 10–20 minutes followed by numbness and mild dysarthria, then a pounding headache with photophobia and nausea; one episode included vomiting. Symptoms often start after exertion during soccer practice and began two weeks after a self-limited upper respiratory illness. Episodes last several hours and her school performance has declined. She denies loss of consciousness, fever, neck stiffness, or recent head trauma. Family history is notable for maternal migraine with aura. No prior neurologic disorders; immunizations up to date. She is otherwise healthy and not taking regular medications."
P0748,"A 95-year-old man presents with six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a dry cough, with a three-day acute worsening after a mild upper respiratory illness. He now notes resting breathlessness and intermittent low-grade fevers, and his family reports an 8-pound unintentional weight loss over two months. On exertion he becomes markedly short of breath and coughs without hemoptysis; he also reports new orthopnea and mild lower extremity swelling. He has a remote 30-pack-year smoking history. Exam at home showed increased work of breathing and bibasilar fine inspiratory crackles; oxygen saturation falls with minimal ambulation. He denies chest pain or syncope. The constellation is most consistent with progressive interstitial lung disease with acute decompensation versus superimposed infection or heart failure."
P0749,A 95-year-old female presents with sudden-onset left hemiparesis and expressive aphasia noted by family 36 hours ago. Symptoms began abruptly while she was sitting and progressed over minutes; family also observed a new right facial droop and intermittent choking with thin liquids consistent with oropharyngeal dysphagia. She had two days of malaise and low-grade fever before the event and is now intermittently confused and unable to complete basic self-care. Past medical history includes chronic atrial fibrillation and hypertension; she is not anticoagulated because of recurrent falls. No known recent head trauma or seizure activity. Examination at home suggested decreased left-sided strength and diminished verbal output compared with baseline.
P0750,"A 99-year-old female with longstanding hypertension, known COPD, and chronic diastolic heart failure presents with five days of progressive dyspnea and a productive cough. Symptoms began after a brief upper respiratory illness and have worsened with minimal exertion; she reports yellow-green sputum and low-grade fevers. Family notes increasing orthopnea and two nights of poor sleep from breathlessness, now accompanied by mild confusion and reduced oral intake. On exam at home she was noted to have new bilateral lower extremity swelling and audible rattles when lying flat. The clinical picture is most consistent with a congestive exacerbation complicated by superimposed lower respiratory infection, with hypoxemic symptoms out of proportion to her baseline COPD."
P0751,
P0752,An 82-year-old male reports three weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent nonproductive cough that began after a brief upper respiratory illness. He describes marked decline in exercise tolerance — now breathless after walking half a block — and a 10-pound unintentional weight loss over the same interval. He denies hemoptysis but notes intermittent low-grade chills. Past history includes well-controlled hypertension and a prior diagnosis of COPD; he is a former smoker. At baseline he used to be independent but has needed more frequent rest breaks. On self-exam he has noticed widening of his fingertips and bedside exam revealed bibasilar inspiratory crackles. He is concerned about worsening interstitial lung disease versus superimposed infection or malignancy.
P0753,"A 22-year-old female presents with progressive right leg weakness and numbness for ten days, worsened over the past 72 hours. Symptoms began after a self-limited upper respiratory illness three weeks ago and initially involved distal paresthesia in the foot, now extending to the thigh with new gait instability and difficulty climbing stairs. She describes intermittent electric shock–like sensations down the spine with neck flexion and a two-day episode of blurred vision in the right eye that has partially resolved. She also reports new urinary urgency and hesitancy without dysuria, increased fatigue, and episodic headaches consistent with her history of migraine. She denies recent trauma, high fevers, or illicit drug use. No prior neurologic deficits; baseline anxiety managed nonpharmacologically."
P0754,"A previously healthy 4-year-old girl presents with a four-day history of progressive noisy breathing and a barky cough that began after two days of clear rhinorrhea. Parents report nocturnal worsening with intermittent inspiratory stridor and audible wheeze, particularly at night and with crying, accompanied by low-grade fever and reduced oral intake. Today she has increased work of breathing with mild intercostal retractions and hoarseness but no vomiting or cyanosis. Family notes prior episodes of viral-induced wheeze at age two and a history of atopic dermatitis. Exam at home suggested persistent stridor at rest. Parents are concerned about respiratory distress overnight; symptoms feel distinct from prior reactive episodes and are most consistent with a croup-like illness possibly triggering bronchospasm."
P0755,"A 5-year-old female presents with four days of progressive cough and noisy breathing. Symptoms began as clear rhinorrhea and a low-grade fever after daycare exposure and have evolved into a persistent, harsh cough with frequent nocturnal paroxysms and audible expiratory wheeze. Parents note increased work of breathing with activity, occasional subcostal retractions, decreased oral intake, and mild lethargy. She has intermittent posttussive vomiting but no choking episode. Past history is notable for viral-associated wheeze and atopic dermatitis; no prior hospitalizations. There is concurrent nasal congestion and mild ear tugging. Parents report minimal improvement with humidified air at home and are concerned about worsening shortness of breath, raising concern for a viral-triggered asthma/reactive airways exacerbation."
P0756,"A 51-year-old woman reports sudden, painless loss of vision in her right eye over the past 48 hours, preceded for two weeks by intermittent transient blackouts described as brief grayouts and one-minute episodes of blurred vision (amaurosis fugax). She now has persistent severe blur with new floaters and occasional flashes of light but denies ocular pain or trauma. She also notes a mild right temporal headache and recent episodes of palpitations and lightheadedness. Past history is notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She denies fever, jaw claudication, or recent infection. Given the acute monocular ischemic picture, she is worried about an arterial occlusion and reports urgent evaluation in clinic where decreased vision was confirmed, prompting planned vascular and cardiac workup."
P0757,
P0758,
P0759,"An 18-year-old female reports five days of progressive bilateral leg weakness and numbness, now causing tripping and difficulty climbing stairs. Symptoms began as intermittent paresthesias in the feet and evolved to constant sensory loss with gait instability and a bandlike mid-thoracic back pain. She notes urinary hesitancy with one episode of retention and new difficulty sensing vibration in the toes. Flexing the neck provokes electric shock–like sensations. Symptoms began roughly two weeks after a self-limited upper respiratory illness. On review she endorses no visual loss or fever. She is concerned for an inflammatory myelopathy (e.g., transverse myelitis or early demyelinating disease) given the subacute progression, sensory level, hyperreflexia, and autonomic bladder symptoms."
P0760,"A 41-year-old man presents with five days of progressive shortness of breath and a new sharp, pleuritic right-sided chest pain that began acutely two days ago. Pain is worse with inspiration and with deep cough; he reports scant hemoptysis once yesterday. He notes palpitations and intermittent lightheadedness when climbing stairs. Symptoms started after a prolonged cross-country flight last week; he also developed right calf swelling and tenderness over the past 48 hours. He is a current cigarette smoker (about one pack per day) and recalls a mild upper respiratory illness two weeks ago. He denies fever at home but feels warm with exertion. No prior clotting disorder. He is anxious about possible pulmonary embolism given the timeline and leg findings."
P0761,"A 14-year-old female presents with a six-week history of progressive palpitations, tremulousness, and heat intolerance. She reports a two-month pattern of increased sweating, more frequent loose bowel movements, and an unintentional weight loss despite unchanged appetite. Parents note worsening irritability and insomnia interfering with school. Menstrual cycles, previously regular, have become irregular over the past two months. On exam at the clinic she felt her heart racing with minimal exertion and mentioned a new fullness at the base of her neck; she also describes intermittent sensation of eye grittiness and lid retraction. There is no history of recent infection or medication changes. Symptoms began gradually and have intensified over the last several weeks, prompting evaluation for a possible hyperthyroid process."
P0762,"An 85-year-old female reports three months of progressive exertional dyspnea that began after a self-limited bronchitic illness. Initially she had a dry cough that never fully resolved and now experiences breathlessness with minimal exertion, notably when climbing a single flight of stairs. Her primary care clinician documented bibasilar inspiratory crackles and new digital clubbing. She notes reduced walking tolerance and intermittent lightheadedness on exertion; home pulse oximetry has fallen into the high 80s while ambulating. No fever or hemoptysis. On review, she has mild unintentional weight loss and daytime fatigue. The clinical picture is most consistent with an interstitial process, with concern for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis complicated by secondary pulmonary hypertension and exertional hypoxemia."
P0763,"A 69-year-old woman reports three months of progressive exertional dyspnea with a persistent dry cough that has acutely worsened over the past two weeks. She endorses intermittent pleuritic chest discomfort, low-grade fevers, and an unintentional 10-pound weight loss with decreased appetite. She denies hemoptysis or new cardiac symptoms but notes marked decline in exercise tolerance; oxygen saturation falls into the mid-80s with moderate exertion. Exam reveals bibasilar fine inspiratory crackles and early digital clubbing. Past medical history is notable only for well-controlled hypertension; she is a former 30 pack-year smoker. No recent infectious exposures. The clinical picture is concerning for a chronic interstitial lung process with superimposed acute worsening."
P0764,"A 16-year-old female reports three weeks of progressively worsening daily holocephalic headache, described as dull and pressure-like, with associated photophobia and nausea. Over the past ten days she has developed intermittent binocular horizontal diplopia and transient visual obscurations triggered by standing, and she hears a unilateral pulsatile tinnitus. Her primary care clinician noted bilateral optic disc swelling on fundoscopic exam and referred her urgently. She endorses a 25-pound weight gain over six months and irregular menses. She denies fever, focal numbness, limb weakness, or head trauma. Sleep and school attendance are increasingly affected. No tobacco or illicit drug use. Current concern is raised intracranial pressure, and she seeks evaluation for possible idiopathic intracranial hypertension."

P0771,"A 65-year-old woman reports recurrent transient episodes of slurred speech and left arm weakness over the past two weeks. Each spell lasts 10–20 minutes, is sometimes preceded by lightheadedness after exertion, and is accompanied by brief episodes of blurred vision described as transient monocular vision loss. She also notes intermittent confusion and new gait instability between events. She has known hypertension and chronic atrial fibrillation and is maintained on anticoagulation; she denies fever or headache. On recent primary care exam a right-sided carotid bruit was documented. She is concerned these represent transient ischemic attacks rather than peripheral vertigo, given the focal motor and speech features, and seeks urgent evaluation for cerebrovascular imaging and possible carotid stenosis."
P0772,"A 0-year-old female brought by caregiver for 48 hours of progressive respiratory distress following two days of rhinorrhea and low‑grade fever. Caregiver notes persistent cough, audible labored breathing and markedly reduced oral intake to less than half usual volumes with fewer wet diapers. At home there were frequent rapid breaths with nasal flaring and visible intercostal retractions, and brief self‑resolving color change episodes with stimulation. Clinic pulse oximetry showed intermittent desaturations into the low 90s. Lung auscultation was notable for diffuse expiratory wheeze without focal crackles. No significant vomiting. Birth history uncomplicated and no prior admissions. Working impression is viral bronchiolitis with hypoxemia, feeding intolerance and early dehydration, raising concern for observation for apnea‑like events and supportive care."

P0796,"A 37-year-old woman presents with three days of progressive shortness of breath and sharp right-sided pleuritic chest pain that began abruptly after she noticed swelling in her right calf. Dyspnea is worse with exertion and accompanied by a dry cough and a single episode of scant hemoptysis yesterday. She reports palpitations and intermittent lightheadedness but denies fever or productive sputum. She recently completed a long cross-country driving trip and takes combined oral contraception. Past history is notable only for seasonal allergic rhinitis; she has no known chronic lung disease or prior thromboembolism. Symptoms started after several days of prolonged sitting, and she has curtailed activity because of exertional intolerance."
P0797,"A 42-year-old man presents with six weeks of progressive epigastric pain and early satiety, describing a gnawing, postprandial discomfort that intensifies after solid meals and is occasionally followed by nonbloody vomiting. He reports a 10-pound unintended weight loss and new fatigue over the same interval. Over the past two weeks he has noticed intermittent dark, tarry stools and lightheadedness on standing. He has a remote history of peptic ulcer disease and acknowledges frequent ibuprofen use for back pain. He has well-controlled type 2 diabetes and notes prior episodes of prolonged fullness after meals, raising concern for gastroparesis versus recurrent ulcer-related gastric outlet obstruction. No fevers, jaundice, or alcohol bingeing are reported. He seeks evaluation for endoscopic assessment and anemia workup."
P0798,"A 6-year-old female is brought for three months of progressively muffled hearing and new difficulty following classroom instructions. Symptoms began after a prolonged upper respiratory infection and have been accompanied by intermittent ear fullness and two brief episodes of ear pain with low-grade fever over the past year. Parents report chronic nasal obstruction, persistent mouth-breathing, and loud snoring at night for six months. Her teacher notes unclear speech and inattentiveness. Prior care included two courses of antibiotics for acute otitis media. On home otoscopy parents described dullness and occasional fluid behind both ears. Overall picture suggests adenoid hypertrophy with eustachian tube dysfunction leading to serous otitis media, conductive hearing loss, recurrent URI symptoms, and concern for speech delay."
P0799,"A 54-year-old man reports three days of progressive shortness of breath with sudden-onset, pleuritic right-sided chest pain 36 hours ago. He describes scant hemoptysis and marked exercise intolerance, worsened after a 10-hour car trip last week. He has a 30–pack-year smoking history and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with known hypertension. Over the past two days he developed aching and swelling of the right calf and intermittent palpitations; he denies fever or purulent sputum. At home he noted lightheadedness with one near-syncope. The combination of unilateral leg swelling, pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia and hypoxemic symptoms on a background of COPD raises concern for acute pulmonary embolism complicating chronic airway disease; he reports no prior DVT or anticoagulation."

He also endorses two months of morning shoulder and hip stiffness limiting dressing, consistent with polymyalgia rheumatica. Past history is notable for hypertension. He denies trauma, ocular redness, or photophobia. The constellation of acute monocular visual loss with temporal symptoms raises concern for anterior ischemic optic neuropathy due to giant cell arteritis and warrants urgent evaluation to preserve vision."
P0830,"A 56-year-old female reports progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough for four months. She initially became short of breath with brisk walks but now tires with minimal household activity; symptoms reliably worsen after cleaning her apartment aviary. She also describes intermittent low-grade fevers, unintentional 6-lb weight loss, and new fatigue, and denies chest pain or orthopnea. Prior exam noted inspiratory bibasilar crackles and early digital clubbing. Home pulse oximetry shows desaturation into the mid-80s with ambulation. Pulmonary function testing revealed a restrictive pattern with reduced DLCO, and CT chest reportedly demonstrates basilar reticulation with patchy ground-glass opacities. The presentation is most consistent with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis or another interstitial lung disease related to avian exposure."
P0831,"A 48-year-old man reports six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a productive cough that began after a community-acquired pneumonia. Sputum has become more purulent and is occasionally blood-tinged.

P0837,"A 92-year-old female reports acute, progressive loss of vision in the right eye over four days after several brief, transient episodes of complete blackout in that eye over the preceding two weeks. She describes a central dark spot and difficulty reading and recognizing faces; the episodes were painless but now the deficit persists. Over the same interval she has developed new temporal scalp tenderness and intermittent jaw claudication when chewing. She notes increasing malaise but denies headache or focal weakness. Past history is notable for hypertension and long-standing bilateral cataracts with reduced baseline acuity. She is worried the brief losses represented embolic “shadows”; she understands the change is different and more severe than her chronic cataract-related blurring."
P0838,"A 75-year-old man presents with three months of progressively worsening exertional dyspnea and decreased exercise tolerance, now limiting him to short walks. He reports a persistent, nonproductive cough and new bilateral ankle swelling; he notes intermittent palpitations and fatigue with minimal exertion. He says he had a provoked deep venous thrombosis with presumed pulmonary embolism about 18 months ago that was treated. He has chronic hypertension and a remote smoking history. On exertion he becomes breathless and has documented oxygen desaturation at home. He denies chest pain, fevers, or hemoptysis. The constellation of progressive dyspnea, prior thromboembolism, peripheral edema, and exertional hypoxemia raises concern for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension complicating underlying cardiopulmonary disease."
P0839,"A 53-year-old woman reports two weeks of progressive central blurring in the right eye with intermittent metamorphopsia and new floaters; she describes brief flashes of light in that eye several times per day.

Episodes last several hours and are now accompanied by transient right-sided weakness and clumsiness with fine motor tasks. He describes a sharp occipital headache worsened by neck flexion with brief electric sensations down the spine (Lhermitte phenomenon). He also had one self-limited episode of blurred vision in the left eye with color desaturation and photophobia over 48 hours. Gait has been unsteady at times, and he notes new urinary urgency without dysuria. Symptoms began after a mild upper respiratory illness; he denies trauma, fever, or prior similar attacks."
P0855,"A 97-year-old man presents with three months of progressive gait instability and two recent falls. Family describes a shuffling, difficulty-initiating or ""magnetic"" gait with frequent steps that are narrow and slow, accompanied by increasing urinary urgency and intermittent urge incontinence. There is noticeable cognitive slowing and diminished initiation compared with baseline, and both mobility and mentation seemed to worsen after a recently treated urinary tract infection. He also reports episodic lightheadedness on standing with near-syncope suggestive of orthostatic dizziness. A prior non-contrast head CT reportedly showed ventriculomegaly greater than expected for atrophy, raising concern for normal-pressure hydrocephalus. No new focal weakness or sensory loss is appreciated, though lower-extremity stiffness and deconditioning markedly limit function. Caregiver seeks evaluation for possible CSF diversion versus addressing reversible contributors."

One week before symptoms she had a mild viral upper respiratory illness. She also describes two brief episodes of left-arm numbness and tingling in the past month that resolved spontaneously. An urgent assessment documented a right afferent pupillary defect and subtle optic disc edema. She denies trauma, contact lens use, fever, or prior autoimmune diagnosis. Family history is notable for autoimmune thyroid disease."
P0863,"A 91-year-old male presents with five days of progressive dyspnea and a productive, yellow-green cough. Symptoms began after a brief choking episode on solids one week ago; he has known oropharyngeal dysphagia since a prior left hemispheric stroke. He also notes low-grade fevers, decreased appetite, and increased fatigue. Baseline mobility is limited by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which he reports has been stable until this episode. On arrival he is tachypneic with resting hypoxemia and exam reveals coarse crackles and diminished breath sounds at the right base. Portable chest radiograph performed in the ED demonstrates a right lower lobe consolidation. Impression is likely aspiration pneumonia on a background of COPD contributing to acute respiratory compromise."
P0864,
P0865,"A 49-year-old female reports four months of progressively worse epigastric pain radiating to the back, classically worse after meals, accompanied by oily, foul-smelling stools and early satiety. She notes an unintentional 15-pound weight loss and intermittent yellowing of the eyes with pale stools over the past six weeks. Symptoms began after a hospitalization for presumed biliary colic and suspected gallstone pancreatitis six months ago. She was recently found to have elevated fasting glucose and new-onset diabetes. She denies heavy alcohol use currently but describes episodic nausea without frank vomiting. No fevers or melena. She is most concerned about continued weight loss and worsening malabsorption and requests evaluation for possible chronic pancreatitis versus an obstructing pancreatic head process."
P0866,"An 86-year-old woman presents with a three-week history of progressive central visual blurring and distortion in the right eye. She describes straight lines becoming wavy (metamorphopsia), a persistent central scotoma that interferes with reading and face recognition, and intermittent micropsia; she has noticed new floaters but denies flashes, ocular pain, or headache. Symptoms began with subtle difficulty reading small print and have steadily worsened, now requiring a handheld magnifier. Past ocular history includes cataract extraction in both eyes. Medical history notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. No recent trauma, systemic constitutional symptoms, or prior intravitreal injections. Concern is raised for new neovascular age-related macular degeneration with possible choroidal neovascularization prompting urgent ophthalmology evaluation."
P0867,A 15-year-old female presents with three days of progressive shortness of breath and a sharp right-sided pleuritic chest pain that began abruptly after a severe coughing spell. Symptoms followed a five-day viral upper respiratory infection with nasal congestion and sore throat; she now has intermittent dry cough and mild subjective fever. Parents note increased breathing effort with exertion and occasional palpitations at rest. She started combined oral contraceptives six weeks ago and has no recent travel or immobilization. On exam she appears tachypneic with focal reduction in right-sided breath sounds. Differential includes pulmonary embolism versus secondary spontaneous pneumothorax; an asthma exacerbation triggered by the preceding infection is also considered. She denies leg swelling or prior thrombotic history.
P0868,"A 49-year-old man reports two weeks of intermittent focal neurologic symptoms characterized by brief episodes of right arm numbness and weakness accompanied by word‑finding difficulty and slurred speech. The spells began as fleeting paresthesias after exertion and have progressed to several daily episodes lasting five to twenty minutes; he had one episode this week of transient darkening in the left eye. Symptoms resolve completely between events. Past history is notable for untreated hypertension and hyperlipidemia; he currently smokes and his partner recently noticed a new left‑sided neck bruit. He denies headache, fever, chest pain, or syncope. The temporal pattern and mixed cortical and ocular findings are most concerning for left‑hemispheric transient ischemic attacks, raising concern for ipsilateral carotid stenosis or an embolic source."
P0869,"A 74-year-old woman presents with six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea that began after a self-limited bronchitic illness. She now tires after walking a single block and has a persistent dry cough with occasional scant sputum and mild night sweats. Family notes 4 kg of unintentional weight loss and increased breathlessness over two weeks. On exam she has bibasilar inspiratory crackles and mild finger clubbing by report; oxygen saturation falls with minimal exertion. She has a remote 20-pack-year smoking history and longstanding hypertension. She denies chest pain, orthopnea, or leg swelling. Concern is for a subacute interstitial lung process—possible pulmonary fibrosis or post-infectious exacerbation—rather than simple reactive airways disease."
P0870,
P0871,"A 13-year-old female reports six weeks of progressive palpitations and a persistent resting fast pulse, noted by family at home. She has lost about 3 kg despite an increased appetite, and describes new heat intolerance with frequent sweating and a fine tremor of her hands. Mother noticed a fullness at the front of the neck over the last month. She also reports irregular periods and reduced exercise tolerance, stopping soccer practices because she tires more quickly. Symptoms began gradually after a brief viral upper respiratory illness and have steadily worsened; she denies fever, rash, or illicit drug use. There is no prior endocrine disease in the patient, and home pulse checks are consistently in the 100s."
P0872,"A 53-year-old man reports three weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and increased cough following a viral upper respiratory illness. He describes a daily productive cough with green sputum, nocturnal cough waking him twice weekly, and new orthopnea requiring two pillows. He notes wheeze with minimal exertion and developing bilateral ankle swelling over the past week. He has a 35–pack-year smoking history and a prior diagnosis of chronic bronchitic COPD; he also has known hypertension. He denies fever but had a single episode of scant blood-tinged sputum. Symptoms began after the URI and have steadily worsened, prompting concern for COPD exacerbation with possible congestive decompensation and secondary pulmonary hypertension."
P0873,A 32-year-old male aviary hobbyist reports six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent nonproductive cough that began after deep-cleaning his pigeon loft. He describes intermittent pleuritic chest discomfort and low-grade fevers with an unintended five-kilogram weight loss. Symptoms partially abated after a brief outpatient prednisone course but recurred on return to the birds. Exam notable for fine inspiratory crackles at the bases and early digital clubbing. He is a former 5–pack-year smoker and otherwise healthy. Chest CT performed by his primary clinician showed patchy bilateral ground-glass opacities. The clinical picture is concerning for hypersensitivity pneumonitis from avian antigen exposure versus another subacute interstitial lung process.
P0874,"A 45-year-old woman reports a four-day history of progressively worsening bifrontal headache accompanied by new right-sided weakness and intermittent visual blurring. The headache is constant, worse with Valsalva, and has been associated with nausea and two brief witnessed generalized shaking episodes. Family notes increasing confusion and slowed speech over 24 hours. She has a long-standing history of episodic migraine but describes this pain as different and more severe; exam earlier noted mild papilledema. She completed treatment for acute sinusitis three weeks ago and has been using combined oral contraceptives for several months for menorrhagia. The constellation of severe headache, focal neurologic deficit, seizures, and papilledema is concerning for a cerebral venous thrombosis versus other intracranial process."
P0875,"A 48-year-old man reports two weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and intermittent substernal tightness that began after a self-limited febrile upper respiratory illness three weeks ago. He now has orthopnea and awakens once nightly with shortness of breath consistent with paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, new bilateral ankle swelling, and a marked decline in exercise tolerance — formerly could bicycle 30 minutes, now breathless after minimal exertion. He describes intermittent palpitations and occasional lightheadedness without syncope, along with persistent fatigue and poor appetite. He denies productive cough or hemoptysis. No prior cardiac hospitalization, though he notes a remote history of hypercholesterolemia. Symptoms raise concern for new cardiac dysfunction, possibly post-viral cardiomyopathy or an arrhythmic process, prompting urgent evaluation."
P0876,"A 4-year-old boy presents with a three-day runny nose that progressed to 48 hours of a progressively barky cough and noisy breathing. Parents describe pronounced nocturnal worsening with intermittent inspiratory stridor and hoarseness, episodes of audible expiratory wheeze, and a low-grade fever to about 38°C. He now has mild tachypnea with suprasternal retractions and decreased oral intake because coughing provokes gagging. Symptoms improve modestly with cool-mist humidification and a single dose of acetaminophen, but several cough spells are prolonged and tiring. There is no drooling, vomiting, or witnessed foreign-body event. Past history notable for RSV bronchiolitis as an infant and atopic dermatitis, with no prior chronic lung disease."
P0877,
P0878,"A 31-year-old woman presents with two weeks of progressive neurologic symptoms beginning as intermittent right-sided paresthesias and evolving to persistent numbness of the right forearm and foot, with new mild right leg weakness causing tripping. She also reports intermittent horizontal diplopia and days of blurred vision in the left eye, and a transient Lhermitte-like electric sensation with neck flexion. Symptoms began about ten days after a self-limited upper respiratory illness and have been associated with profound fatigue and recent urinary urgency. She denies fever, headache, or recent trauma. Past history notable for episodic migraines in adolescence and baseline anxiety. Symptoms are interfering with work and ambulation, prompting urgent evaluation for a possible demyelinating or inflammatory process."
P0879,
P0880,
P0881,"A 65-year-old woman presents with two weeks of progressive central blurring and distortion in the left eye, now evolving over 48 hours into marked central vision loss with difficulty reading and loss of contrast. She describes intermittent metamorphopsia and new floaters that preceded the decline. Over the same interval she developed a dull left temporal headache with scalp tenderness and jaw claudication when chewing, without fever or trauma. She recalls brief transient monocular visual obscurations several months ago. Past medical history includes longstanding hypertension and hyperlipidemia and prior uncomplicated cataract extraction in both eyes. She denies diplopia, systemic rash, or recent infections. Symptoms suggest an ischemic optic process and prompt urgent ophthalmology and vascular assessment."
P0882,
P0883,"A 24-year-old man presents with a six-day history of worsening bifrontal throbbing headache, worse in the mornings and with Valsalva, accompanied by marked photophobia and persistent nausea. Two days into the headache he noted transient right-sided hand and forearm numbness lasting about 15 minutes, and since day three he reports mild neck stiffness and a low-grade fever. He had a viral upper respiratory illness about two weeks ago with lingering nasal congestion and pressure, but denies recent travel or illicit drug use. Over the past 48 hours he developed intermittent blurred vision; on self-check his vision seems slightly worse and light sensitivity has increased. He has not had similar episodes previously and seeks evaluation for an evolving neurological process."
P0884,"A 55-year-old woman reports three weeks of intermittent palpitations and new lightheadedness, worse with minimal exertion and occurring several times daily. She notes an unintentional 8-lb weight loss, increased sweating and heat intolerance, a fine hand tremor, and looser stools without blood. Symptoms have progressed from brief episodes to prolonged spells with a sensation of an irregular heartbeat; she measured a rapid, irregular pulse at home. She denies chest pain or syncope. On self-exam she recently noticed fullness at the front of her neck; on exam there is a diffusely enlarged, non-tender thyroid and an irregularly irregular tachycardia consistent with atrial fibrillation. Past history notable only for well-controlled hypertension. No recent travel or medication changes."
P0885,"A 68-year-old female reports progressive exertional dyspnea over the past six months, with marked decline in walking tolerance and increasing shortness of breath when climbing stairs. She also has a persistent dry cough and generalized fatigue; she notes unintentional weight loss of several pounds and no fevers or hemoptysis. Over the last four weeks she has noticed lightheadedness and episodic oxygen desaturation with exertion. Exam shows bibasilar ""Velcro"" inspiratory crackles, mild digital clubbing, and trace pitting edema of the ankles. She is a former smoker and has a history of well-controlled hypertension. Symptoms acutely worsened after a respiratory infection two months ago. The presentation is most concerning for chronic interstitial lung disease with possible secondary pulmonary hypertension/right-heart strain."
P0886,"A 35-year-old woman three weeks postpartum reports five days of sharp, pleuritic right-sided chest pain and progressive exertional dyspnea. The pain is worse with deep inspiration and coughing; she also notes intermittent palpitations and mild lightheadedness when climbing stairs. Two weeks ago she had a brief febrile upper respiratory illness, and she had a prolonged car ride home shortly thereafter. Over the past 48 hours she developed new right calf aching with visible swelling and one scant episode of blood-tinged sputum. She has no personal history of coagulopathy. Given her postpartum status, recent immobilization, unilateral calf swelling, and acute pleuritic symptoms, she is highly suspicious for deep venous thrombosis with possible pulmonary embolism."
P0887,A 47-year-old male presents with a three-week history of progressive exertional dyspnea and intermittent right-sided pleuritic chest pain. He describes a dry cough that has recently produced small amounts of blood on two occasions and associated low-grade fevers with night sweats. Symptoms began after a ten-hour bus trip; he also developed new left calf swelling and aching. He has a 12–pack-year smoking history and works in construction with intermittent silica dust exposure. He denies known asthma or prior pneumonia but notes occasional exertional wheeze and easy fatigability. He reports brief presyncope with exertion. Concern is for pulmonary embolism with possible pulmonary infarction on a background of smoking-related airway disease; concurrent leg DVT and occupational lung exposure are relevant.
P0888,"A 54-year-old man with type 2 diabetes reports a ten-day history of progressive right periorbital pain and swelling that began after a presumed sinus infection. He notes increasing blurred vision in the right eye and new horizontal diplopia when looking laterally. Over the past 48 hours he developed mild proptosis and worsening eyelid erythema; pain is constant and exacerbated by eye movement. He also endorses low-grade fever and malaise. On exam in clinic he has limited extraocular movements on the right and subjective color desaturation. Given the temporal sequence from ethmoid sinusitis to orbital inflammation with ophthalmoplegia and acute visual decline, he is most concerning for orbital cellulitis with possible cavernous sinus thrombosis requiring urgent imaging and specialist evaluation."
P0889,"A 53-year-old woman presents with ten days of progressive right-eye blurring and a new inferior visual field defect, initially intermittent haze that now limits reading. The visual decline followed onset of a persistent, gnawing right temporal headache and localized scalp tenderness over the temple. She reports jaw claudication when chewing and proximal morning stiffness of shoulders and hips for several weeks consistent with polymyalgia rheumatica. Mild low-grade fevers accompany the systemic symptoms. Past medical history includes well-controlled hypertension. She denies ocular discharge or trauma. The temporal pain and jaw claudication preceded the acuity loss, raising concern for a vasculitic process such as giant cell arteritis with ischemic optic involvement; she is seeking urgent ophthalmology and rheumatology assessment."
P0890,"A 73-year-old female presents with two weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and reduced tolerance for her usual household activities. She describes new orthopnea, requiring two pillows for the past five nights, and one episode of abrupt nighttime breathlessness suggestive of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Family reports a 3–4 kg weight gain and new bilateral pitting ankle edema over ten days. She denies chest pain but notes intermittent palpitations. Symptoms began after a self-limited upper respiratory illness three weeks ago and have steadily worsened. Past history is notable for long-standing hypertension and osteoarthritis without prior heart-failure diagnosis. Home exam reportedly showed mild bibasilar crackles. Concern is for decompensated heart failure, likely HFpEF related to hypertension, with possible new atrial fibrillation."
P0891,"A 19-year-old male college student reports six weeks of progressive polyuria and polydipsia with an unintended 11-pound weight loss, now presenting with 48 hours of worsening nausea, recurrent vomiting, and diffuse, crampy abdominal pain. Over the past day he developed increasing fatigue, lightheadedness and rapid, deep breathing; family members noted intermittent confusion and reduced urine output. He is insulin-dependent and missed his evening dose two nights ago after a brief gastroenteritis with poor oral intake. On review he describes dry mouth and a pounding heartbeat but denies fever or focal neurologic deficits. The timeline and constellation of polyuria, weight loss, vomiting, tachypnea, tachycardia and mental status change suggest severe hyperglycemia with possible diabetic ketoacidosis."
P0892,
P0893,"An 18-year-old male reports sudden onset of right-sided pleuritic chest pain and progressive shortness of breath over the past 36 hours. Pain began during an intense basketball practice, is sharp, worse with deep inspiration and coughing, and is associated with a dry cough and mild lightheadedness. He had a brief upper respiratory sniffle three days earlier that seemed to improve. He notes intermittent palpitations and rapid breathing but denies fever, hemoptysis, calf pain, or recent trauma. He describes a tall, thin body habitus and occasional marijuana vaping. On self-exam he felt mild crepitus over the right chest and reports decreased air movement on that side. Presentation is most consistent with a primary spontaneous pneumothorax requiring prompt evaluation."
P0894,"A 56-year-old man reports six weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough that began after a brief upper respiratory illness. He now becomes short of breath walking a flight of stairs and notes intermittent pleuritic left-sided chest discomfort with deep inspiration. Over the same interval he has experienced low-grade fevers and an unintentional 10-pound weight loss. He is a 30-pack-year former smoker and has a history of well-controlled hypertension. At home he has noticed oxygen saturation falls with exertion and occasional wheeze when active. He denies hemoptysis or chest pressure at rest. Symptoms have slowly worsened, raising concern for an evolving interstitial or postinfectious pulmonary process versus atypical infection."
P0895,"A 69-year-old man reports ten days of progressive blurring and distortion of the left central visual field, now described as a dense central scotoma with intermittent metamorphopsia. He experienced a brief episode of transient monocular vision loss two weeks ago. Over the past week he developed throbbing left temporal headache, scalp tenderness, and jaw claudication when chewing, accompanied by low-grade fevers and malaise. He denies trauma, eye discharge, or significant photophobia but notes mild diplopia on extreme gaze. Past medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Ophthalmology documented decreased visual acuity and a pale, swollen left optic disc, raising concern for arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy from suspected giant cell arteritis; urgent rheumatology/vascular evaluation was requested."
P0896,"A 68-year-old female presents with sudden, painless loss of vision in the right eye over 48 hours, preceded by a three-week history of new persistent temporal headache and scalp tenderness when brushing her hair. She describes intermittent jaw claudication with chewing and prominent morning stiffness in the shoulders and hips consistent with polymyalgia rheumatica. She has experienced low-grade fevers and a three-pound unintentional weight loss in the past month. Past medical history is notable for well-controlled hypertension. She denies prior ocular disease, recent trauma, or neurologic deficits. The temporal pattern and associated systemic symptoms raise concern for giant cell (temporal) arteritis with ischemic optic neuropathy as the likely cause of acute monocular vision loss."
P0897,"A 37-year-old man presents with two weeks of progressively worse exertional dyspnea and sharp right-sided pleuritic chest pain. Symptoms began several days after a prolonged flight and were accompanied by new intermittent palpitations and a single episode of small-volume hemoptysis. He also reports recent right calf swelling and aching; he is an active smoker with a 10-pack-year history and uses a rescue inhaler infrequently for childhood asthma. At home he noticed episodes of rapid pulse and mild lightheadedness with exertion; no fever, cough, or weight loss. He describes his exercise tolerance as decreased from running three miles to struggling with one flight of stairs. No prior thromboembolic events, but his father had a ""blood clot"" in his 50s."
P0898,"A 28-year-old woman presents with five days of progressively blurred vision in her left eye, described as a gray wash centrally with difficulty reading and color desaturation. She reports dull retro-orbital pain that worsens with eye movement and associated photophobia; she also notes new floaters intermittently. Symptoms began after a short viral upper respiratory illness. On self-exam she noticed the pupil in the affected eye seemed slower to constrict. She has had increasing fatigue and two brief episodes of numbness and tingling in her right hand over the past week. Past history is notable only for childhood eczema. She denies trauma, contact-lens overwear, or recent travel. She is concerned about optic neuritis and requests ophthalmology and neurology evaluation."
P0899,"A 5-year-old female presents with three weeks of persistent right-sided ear drainage and progressive hearing difficulty. Parents report recurrent upper respiratory infections over the past three months with ongoing nasal congestion and snoring, followed by ear fullness and intermittent otalgia. The drainage is foul-smelling and seropurulent; she has reduced responsiveness to conversational speech at daycare and occasional imbalance when running. Prior brief courses for acute otitis media were helpful initially, but the ear never fully cleared. Current constellation—eustachian tube dysfunction with presumed otitis media with effusion progressing to chronic suppurative otitis media—is suspected, and a cholesteatoma is a concern given the persistent malodorous otorrhea. No high fevers or toxic appearance; development otherwise age-appropriate."
P0900,"A 14-year-old female presents with three days of progressive blurring of the right central vision and aching retro-orbital pain that worsens with eye movement. She describes a gray central scotoma and marked difficulty distinguishing red from green; nearby objects appear faded in the affected eye. Symptoms began two weeks after a febrile upper respiratory illness and were preceded last winter by a brief episode of right hand numbness that resolved in 48 hours. She also has a right-sided frontal headache but denies trauma, photophobia, fever now, or constitutional weight loss. On exam at an urgent care she was noted to have reduced visual acuity in the right eye and a suspected relative afferent pupillary defect; no skin rash or joint swelling. Parents are concerned about persistent vision loss."
P0901,"A 59-year-old man reports three months of gradually progressive exertional dyspnea and a persistent dry cough, with more rapid decline over the past two weeks limiting his usual walks. He denies fevers or purulent sputum but describes occasional pleuritic chest tightness on deep inspiration. On prior exam he was noted to have fine inspiratory crackles at the bases and new digital clubbing. He is a former smoker with long-standing hypertension. He now becomes lightheaded with exertion and notes intermittent breathlessness that is associated with exertional oxygen desaturation and mild ankle swelling. Clinical concern is for interstitial lung disease with developing pulmonary hypertension and early right-sided congestion; further pulmonary evaluation is planned."
